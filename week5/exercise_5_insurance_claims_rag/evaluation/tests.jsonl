{"question": "A policyholder's car was stolen and recovered with a damaged ignition and scratches. The repair estimate is $4,250, but the car is worth $28,500. Should I approve the repairs or total it?", "keywords": ["theft", "recovery", "total loss threshold", "repair estimate", "ACV"], "reference_answer": "You should approve the repairs. The vehicle is deemed repairable because the repair estimate ($4,250) is only 14.9% of the Actual Cash Value ($28,500), which is well below the company's 75% total loss threshold.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Repair cost is significantly below the 75% total loss threshold."}
{"question": "I have a claim for a kitchen fire where the estimate to rebuild is $450,000, but the policy only has a $400,000 dwelling limit. What is the correct payout procedure?", "keywords": ["fire damage", "dwelling limit", "total loss", "Coverage A"], "reference_answer": "Since the reconstruction estimate exceeds the Coverage A limit of $400,000, the dwelling is a total loss. You should approve the full limit of $400,000 minus the applicable deductible (e.g., $1,000), resulting in a net payout of $399,000.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "The loss is total and exceeds policy limits, necessitating a payout of the full dwelling limit."}
{"question": "A claimant is asking for accidental death benefits. The toxicology report shows a BAC of 0.21% and Ambien in his system at the time of a fatal fall from a roof. Should I accept this claim?", "keywords": ["accidental death benefit", "intoxication exclusion", "toxicology", "denial"], "reference_answer": "The claim for Accidental Death Benefit should be refused. The policy contains an Intoxication Exclusion (Section 6.2.d) which states no benefit is payable if death results directly or indirectly from the insured being under the influence of alcohol or any intoxicant. A BAC of 0.21% combined with Zolpidem constitutes severe impairment.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "The death falls under the policy's intoxication exclusion."}
{"question": "A customer is disputing a water damage settlement because they say the 15-year-old custom hardwood floor can't be matched with just a small patch. They want the whole floor replaced. Can I approve this?", "keywords": ["disputed valuation", "hardwood flooring", "like kind and quality", "matching"], "reference_answer": "Yes, you can approve the full replacement. Under the 'like kind and quality' principle, if a 15-year-old custom-stained hardwood cannot be matched seamlessly, and if cupping is observed in adjacent planks, full replacement is warranted to ensure aesthetic uniformity.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Matching existing materials is not feasible, making full replacement necessary to restore the property to its pre-loss condition."}
{"question": "A driver with three speeding tickets and an at-fault accident was rejected by standard carriers and applied through the state's Assigned Risk Plan. Are we obligated to handle their claims if they have an accident?", "keywords": ["Assigned Risk Plan", "servicing carrier", "high-risk", "eligibility"], "reference_answer": "Yes. Once the policy is assigned to us as the servicing carrier, we administer it as if it were a voluntary policy. Claims are handled through our standard procedures, regardless of the policyholder's high-risk status.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "As the assigned servicing carrier, the company is legally obligated to manage the policy and its claims."}
{"question": "An insured wants to be reimbursed for a generator they rented during a 4-day power outage caused by an ice storm. Is this a covered expense?", "keywords": ["power outage", "ALE", "generator rental", "mitigation"], "reference_answer": "Yes, this should be approved. Generator rental and fuel are considered reasonable and necessary 'Additional Living Expenses' (ALE) to mitigate further loss and maintain basic services when a dwelling is uninhabitable due to a covered peril like a severe winter storm.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "The expense is a necessary mitigation step and falls under Additional Living Expenses."}
{"question": "A claim for vandalism was filed for a house that was vacant for 45 days while the owner was trying to sell it. Should I pay the claim?", "keywords": ["vandalism", "vacancy clause", "exclusion", "30 consecutive days"], "reference_answer": "The claim should be refused. The standard policy contains a Vacancy Clause stating that if the dwelling has been vacant for more than 30 consecutive days immediately before the loss, coverage for vandalism, malicious mischief, and glass breakage is suspended.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "The vacancy exceeds the 30-day limit specified in the policy exclusion."}
{"question": "Our insured hit a deer and the repair estimate is $17,500. The car's ACV is $20,750. What is the decision on totaling the vehicle?", "keywords": ["total loss threshold", "ACV", "repair estimate", "75%"], "reference_answer": "The vehicle should be declared a total loss. The repair estimate ($17,500) is 84.34% of the ACV ($20,750), which exceeds the company's total loss threshold of 75% ($15,562.50).", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "The repair costs exceed the 75% total loss threshold."}
{"question": "A policyholder's daughter had an emergency appendectomy 16 days before their trip to Paris. They canceled everything. Are these non-refundable costs covered?", "keywords": ["trip cancellation", "medical emergency", "non-refundable", "travel insurance"], "reference_answer": "Yes, you should approve this claim. Sickness of an immediate family member (daughter) that prevents travel is a covered reason for trip cancellation, provided it is sudden, unforeseen, and documented by a physician.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "The situation meets the policy criteria for trip cancellation due to an unforeseen medical emergency of a family member."}
{"question": "A policyholder wants to recover the full $1,500 replacement cost for a stolen diamond ring, but the theft sub-limit is $1,500 and her deductible is $500. What do I pay?", "keywords": ["theft", "sub-limit", "deductible", "payout calculation"], "reference_answer": "You should pay $1,000. In a theft claim, the deductible is applied to the covered loss amount. Even if the item is worth $1,500, the final payout is the value minus the deductible ($1,500 - $500 = $1,000).", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Standard deductible application to a covered theft loss."}
{"question": "If an adjuster discovers a claimant is performing manual labor on social media despite claiming a total back disability, can I deny the claim?", "keywords": ["social media investigation", "fraud indicators", "disability", "denial"], "reference_answer": "You may escalate for potential refusal. While social media cannot be the sole basis for a decision, if it directly and unambiguously contradicts material facts provided by the claimant, it should be escalated to a senior manager or the SIU for a formal fraud investigation and potential denial.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Direct contradiction of disability claims via public evidence warrants denial based on misrepresentation."}
{"question": "A claimant slipped on an exposed sprinkler head in a playground. The maintenance logs show the last inspection was 45 days ago, but policy requires every 30 days. Should we settle?", "keywords": ["premises liability", "negligence", "maintenance logs", "settlement"], "reference_answer": "Yes, you should settle. Liability is clear because the property owner (the insured) failed to follow their own maintenance protocol (monthly inspections), leading to a hazardous condition (obscured sprinkler head) that caused the injury.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Negligence is established by the failure to adhere to mandatory maintenance schedules."}
{"question": "A policyholder wants to use their own specialized mechanic for a classic car repair rather than our network. Can we deny the higher labor rate?", "keywords": ["classic car", "specialized repair", "labor rate", "policy terms"], "reference_answer": "No, you should not deny the higher rate if it is reasonable for classic car specialists. The Classic Car Policy allows for specialized parts and labor by technicians qualified in restoring vintage vehicles, prioritizing authenticity over standard shop rates.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Classic car policies provide for specialized restoration and repair services."}
{"question": "A worker twisted his wrist when a wrench recoiled. He's been out for 2 weeks. Do I approve TTD benefits?", "keywords": ["Workers' Compensation", "TTD", "date of injury", "wrist sprain"], "reference_answer": "Yes, approve the Temporary Total Disability (TTD) benefits. The injury is work-related and documented by a supervisor and an occupational health clinic. TTD is payable at 66.67% of the employee's average weekly wage during the period they are unable to work.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "The claim meets work-related injury and medical documentation requirements for temporary disability."}
{"question": "A policyholder filed a claim for food spoilage ($400) after a storm. The policy has a $500 general deductible and a $100 spoilage endorsement deductible. Do we pay anything?", "keywords": ["food spoilage", "deductible", "endorsement", "payout"], "reference_answer": "Yes, you should pay $300. The spoilage coverage endorsement typically has its own lower deductible (e.g., $100). You apply the $100 deductible to the $400 loss, regardless of the higher general policy deductible.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "The spoilage endorsement carries a specific deductible that is lower than the main policy deductible."}
{"question": "A claimant submitted a $30,000 bill for a Cyber Extortion event. Does the policy cover the actual ransom payment?", "keywords": ["Cyber Extortion", "ransomware", "policy limits", "retention"], "reference_answer": "Yes, the policy covers payments made to resolve a cyber extortion demand, subject to the sub-limit ($250,000) and the retention ($5,000). The payment must be approved and often involves security experts for negotiation.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Cyber extortion payments are an included coverage under the Cyber Liability terms."}
{"question": "A customer had a pipe burst while they were on a 3-week winter vacation. They had the heat on at 55 degrees. Is this covered?", "keywords": ["burst pipe", "freezing", "reasonable care", "plumbing"], "reference_answer": "Yes, approve the claim. Coverage for freezing of plumbing is provided if the policyholder used reasonable care to maintain heat in the building. Setting the thermostat to 55 degrees meets this requirement.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "The policyholder took reasonable care to maintain heat, fulfilling the condition for coverage."}
{"question": "We paid $2,000 for a claimant's fence repair caused by a neighbor's falling tree. The neighbor's insurance is now reachable. What should I do?", "keywords": ["subrogation", "recovery", "third-party", "deductible"], "reference_answer": "You should initiate subrogation. Since a third party is liable, refers the file to the Subrogation Unit within 30 days. If recovery is successful, you must also attempt to recover and reimburse the policyholder's deductible.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Third-party liability is clear, meeting the criteria for subrogation pursuit."}
{"question": "An applicant failed to mention a DUI conviction from 4 years ago on their auto application. Now they have an accident. Can I deny the accident claim?", "keywords": ["material misrepresentation", "DUI", "denial", "underwriting"], "reference_answer": "Yes, you should escalate for denial. Failing to disclose a DUI is a material misrepresentation because if the insurer had known, it would have declined the policy or charged a higher premium. This may result in the policy being voided from inception.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Material misrepresentation of a driving record is grounds for policy rescission and claim denial."}
{"question": "A policyholder's dog bit a delivery person. The dog is a Golden Retriever with no history of biting. Does the homeowners policy cover the liability?", "keywords": ["dog bite", "liability", "homeowners insurance", "negligence"], "reference_answer": "Yes, approve the claim. The homeowners policy provides personal liability coverage for bodily injury caused by an animal owned by the insured, provided there are no specific breed exclusions or prior known dangerous propensities excluded by the policy.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "The incident is a standard covered liability occurrence under an HO3 policy."}
{"question": "A claimant wants a rental car while their car is being repaired for a non-covered mechanical breakdown. Should I authorize this?", "keywords": ["rental car", "covered incident", "mechanical breakdown", "refusal"], "reference_answer": "The request should be refused. Rental car reimbursement only applies if the vehicle is undrivable or requires repairs because of a *covered incident* under Collision or Comprehensive coverage. Mechanical breakdowns are usually excluded.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "The underlying cause of repair is not a covered peril."}
{"question": "A business owner is claiming 'Loss of Income' but has only been in business for 2 weeks before the fire. How do I calculate the 'but-for' scenario?", "keywords": ["Business Interruption", "forensic accounting", "but-for scenario", "new business"], "reference_answer": "For a new business, you cannot use long-term historical data. You must analyze the business plan, recent sales for those two weeks, and market trends to project a reasonable 'but-for' scenario. This requires a detailed forensic accounting review.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "New businesses are eligible for BI claims, but require specialized projection methodologies."}
{"question": "A claimant's laptop was stolen from their car while parked at a mall. Their Renters policy has $15,000 personal property coverage. Is this covered?", "keywords": ["renters insurance", "personal property", "off-premises", "theft"], "reference_answer": "Yes, this is covered. Renters insurance typically covers personal property owned by the insured anywhere in the world. However, the payout may be limited to 10% of the total property coverage ($1,500) for items usually located away from the primary residence.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Personal property coverage under a renters policy extends worldwide, including off-premises theft."}
{"question": "A customer is demanding an 'Ex Gratia' payment because their claim was technically excluded (pre-existing structural defect), but they've been a loyal customer for 20 years. Should I approve $500?", "keywords": ["ex gratia", "goodwill", "customer dissatisfaction", "exception"], "reference_answer": "You may approve this. An ex gratia payment is appropriate here to maintain goodwill or resolve dissatisfaction for a long-standing customer, even without legal liability, provided it stays within your authority limit (typically up to $1,000 for senior adjusters).", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "The payment is justified as a goodwill gesture for a long-term loyal customer."}
{"question": "A boat owner hit a submerged buoy 100 miles offshore. Their navigational limit is 75 miles. Should we pay for the hull damage?", "keywords": ["boat insurance", "navigational limits", "exclusion", "hull coverage"], "reference_answer": "The claim should be refused. The incident occurred outside the policy's defined navigational limits (75 miles offshore). Policies explicitly exclude coverage for losses occurring beyond these boundaries without an endorsement.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "The loss occurred outside the contractually agreed-upon navigational zone."}
{"question": "A policyholder's house was damaged by a flood. They only have a standard homeowners policy. Can I pay for any part of the damage?", "keywords": ["flood", "homeowners insurance", "exclusion", "water damage"], "reference_answer": "Most standard homeowner policies exclude flood damage. You must refuse the claim for any damage caused by rising surface water or overflow of bodies of water. Advise the policyholder to check if they have a separate NFIP policy.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Flood is a standard exclusion in HO3 policies."}
{"question": "An insured was using their personal car for Uber and had an accident. They don't have a commercial rider. Should we cover the liability?", "keywords": ["ride-sharing", "commercial use", "exclusion", "auto insurance"], "reference_answer": "The claim should be refused. Standard personal auto policies exclude coverage for any vehicle used for commercial livery or ride-sharing purposes unless specifically endorsed with a commercial or ride-sharing rider.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "The vehicle was used for an excluded commercial purpose at the time of the accident."}
{"question": "A policyholder claims a pipe burst, but the adjuster found mold and rot suggesting the leak has been happening for months. Do I pay the claim?", "keywords": ["water damage", "gradual leak", "neglect", "exclusion"], "reference_answer": "The claim should be refused. Most policies cover 'sudden and accidental' water discharge but exclude 'gradual leaks' or seepage occurring over weeks or months, often due to maintenance issues or neglect.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "The damage was caused by a gradual leak, which is a standard policy exclusion."}
{"question": "A claimant's 5-year-old TV was destroyed in a fire. It cost $1,500 new, but a similar new one is $1,000. How much is the ACV payment if the useful life is 10 years?", "keywords": ["ACV", "depreciation", "RCV", "personal property"], "reference_answer": "The ACV payout should be $500. Depreciation is 50% (5 years out of 10-year useful life). Based on the current replacement cost of $1,000, 50% depreciation ($500) results in an ACV of $500.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Calculating Actual Cash Value based on current replacement cost minus age-based depreciation."}
{"question": "A policyholder wants to appeal a claim denial. What is the timeframe for consistent processing?", "keywords": ["appeals process", "Level 1 appeal", "timeframe", "dispute"], "reference_answer": "The policyholder must submit a Level 1 appeal within 90 days of the decision. Once received, the company must acknowledge within 5 business days and issue a written decision within 30 calendar days.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Standardized timelines for managing claim appeals ensure fairness and transparency."}
{"question": "A claimant's building was destroyed. The policy limit is $1 million, but the cleanup and debris removal cost an extra $150,000. Is the extra amount covered?", "keywords": ["debris removal", "policy limits", "additional coverage", "BOP"], "reference_answer": "Yes, partially. Policies typically provide debris removal coverage up to 25% of the direct loss, plus an additional amount (e.g., $25,000) if the total loss plus debris removal exceeds the policy limit.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Debris removal is often an additional coverage that can exceed the main policy limit by a specific stated amount."}
{"question": "During a total loss settlement, the lienholder payoff is $22,000, but the vehicle's ACV is only $18,000. What is our payment obligation?", "keywords": ["total loss", "lienholder payoff", "ACV", "underwater loan"], "reference_answer": "Our obligation is limited to the vehicle's ACV ($18,000 minus the deductible). We pay the ACV to the lienholder, and the insured is responsible for the remaining $4,000 balance plus their deductible to the lender.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "The insurer is only liable for the Actual Cash Value of the asset, not the total loan balance."}
{"question": "A claimant has a receipt for a roof repair done by an unlicenced relative. The rate is $100/hour. Standard local rate is $65/hour. Should I pay the $100/hour?", "keywords": ["repair estimate", "reasonable cost", "labor rate", "negotiation"], "reference_answer": "No. You should only pay the 'usual, customary, and reasonable' (UCR) labor rate for your region, which is $65/hour. The policy covers reasonable repair costs, not inflated rates from non-professional sources.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Settlement is restricted to reasonable and customary market rates for the work performed."}
{"question": "A policyholder's house was broken into. They reported it to us but refuse to file a police report. Can I still pay the theft claim?", "keywords": ["theft", "police report", "proof of loss", "requirement"], "reference_answer": "The claim should be refused or pended. A police report is mandatory for theft and vandalism claims. Failure to provide a police report within a specified period (e.g., 7 days) can result in claim denial.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Filing a police report is a mandatory condition precedent for theft coverage."}
{"question": "An applicant has a 'No-Fault' auto policy in Florida. They were not at fault in an accident. Who pays their medical bills?", "keywords": ["No-Fault", "PIP", "Florida", "medical bills"], "reference_answer": "In a No-Fault state like Florida, each driver's own insurance company pays for their medical expenses via Personal Injury Protection (PIP) coverage, regardless of who caused the accident.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "No-fault regulations require the insured's own PIP coverage to pay medical costs."}
{"question": "A policyholder's 10-year-old roof was damaged by hail. We paid them the ACV of $10,000. They have now completed the repairs for $20,000. Do I pay the remaining $10,000?", "keywords": ["RCV", "depreciation recovery", "proof of repair", "supplemental payment"], "reference_answer": "Yes, you should approve the depreciation recovery payment. Once the policyholder provides proof of repair (receipts/invoices), you pay the withheld depreciation up to the actual amount spent or the RCV limit.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Completion of repairs triggers the release of withheld depreciation under an RCV policy."}
{"question": "A claimant is suing for emotional distress only after seeing their neighbor's house catch fire. Our insured's house was the source. Does our liability policy cover this?", "keywords": ["bodily injury", "emotional distress", "liability", "exclusion"], "reference_answer": "Typically, no. Liability for 'Bodily Injury' usually requires actual physical harm, sickness, or disease. Emotional distress is generally not covered unless it results directly from a physical injury sustained by the claimant.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Emotional distress without physical injury does not meet the policy definition of bodily injury."}
{"question": "An insured wants to take a structured settlement for a $1.2 million injury claim. Are there tax benefits for them?", "keywords": ["structured settlement", "annuity", "tax benefits", "IRC 104"], "reference_answer": "Yes. Periodic payments from a structured settlement for personal physical injury are often tax-free under Internal Revenue Code Section 104(a)(2). This provides long-term financial security compared to a taxable lump sum.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Structured settlements offer significant tax and financial planning advantages for catastrophic injury cases."}
{"question": "A policyholder's basement flooded because their sump pump failed during a thunderstorm. They don't have a specific water backup endorsement. Is this covered?", "keywords": ["sump pump", "water backup", "exclusion", "endorsement"], "reference_answer": "The claim should be refused. Standard homeowner policies exclude water backup through sewers/drains or overflow from a sump pump unless a specific 'Sewer Backup and Sump Pump Overflow' endorsement is active.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "The peril is excluded unless a specific endorsement has been purchased."}
{"question": "We are processing a claim where the adjuster suspects the claimant is using a 'phantom rear-end' staged accident scheme. Should I proceed with payment?", "keywords": ["fraud indicators", "staged accident", "SIU", "suspicious activity"], "reference_answer": "No. You must halt payment and immediately refer the claim to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU). Staged accidents are major fraud indicators that require a full investigation before any disbursement.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Suspicion of organized fraud requires a mandatory SIU investigation before claim resolution."}
{"question": "A customer is claiming for a $500 phone stolen from their boat. The policy has a $1,000 personal effects limit and a $500 deductible. What is the payout?", "keywords": ["personal property", "boat insurance", "deductible", "payout"], "reference_answer": "The payout is $0. The deductible is applied to the covered loss amount. Since the loss ($500) equals the deductible ($500), the insurer pays nothing.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "The loss amount does not exceed the policy deductible."}
{"question": "A driver hit a pedestrian. Their liability limit is $50,000, but the medical bills are $75,000. Do I pay the full $75,000?", "keywords": ["policy limits", "liability", "exhaustion", "BIL"], "reference_answer": "No. Your payout is capped at the $50,000 policy limit. The insured is personally responsible for the remaining $25,000 unless they have an Umbrella policy.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Payment is legally capped at the maximum policy limit stated in the declarations."}
{"question": "A policyholder wants to know if their 'Collision' coverage pays for a tree branch falling on their parked car. Does it?", "keywords": ["Collision", "Comprehensive", "falling objects", "peril"], "reference_answer": "No. Collision covers impact with another vehicle or object while driving. Damage from falling objects (like a tree branch) is a non-collision peril covered under 'Comprehensive' coverage.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "The cause of loss falls under Comprehensive, not Collision coverage."}
{"question": "A claimant is offering a 50/50 liability split for a complex intersection accident where both drivers claim they had a green light. There are no witnesses. Should we accept?", "keywords": ["liability", "dispute", "negotiation", "comparative negligence"], "reference_answer": "Yes, you may accept. In cases of 'word-vs-word' with no objective evidence or witnesses, a 50/50 liability split is often a reasonable compromise to settle the claim and avoid litigation costs.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "A split liability settlement is appropriate when fault cannot be definitively proven for either party."}
{"question": "A policyholder's premium was due on Jan 1st. They had an accident on Jan 15th and still haven't paid. Is the accident covered?", "keywords": ["grace period", "premium", "late payment", "active coverage"], "reference_answer": "Yes, provided they pay the premium within the 30-day grace period (by Jan 31st). During the grace period, the policy remains in force and covers incidents that occur, as long as payment is eventually made.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "The incident occurred during the policy's grace period."}
{"question": "Can I release a claimant's medical records to an at-fault party's attorney without a signed authorization form from the claimant?", "keywords": ["information release", "third party", "authorization", "PII"], "reference_answer": "No. You must not release sensitive personal information like medical records to a third party without an explicit, signed written authorization from the claimant or a valid subpoena/court order.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Releasing private medical data without consent violates privacy laws and company SOPs."}
{"question": "A business is claiming for lost profit because its supplier's factory burned down, even though its own building is fine. Is this covered?", "keywords": ["Business Interruption", "contingent BI", "covered peril", "interruption"], "reference_answer": "This would only be covered if the business has a 'Contingent Business Interruption' endorsement. Standard BI only covers losses resulting from direct physical damage to the insured's own property.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Standard BI policies require physical damage to the insured's premises."}
{"question": "A policyholder hit another car and caused $5,000 in damage. They want to pay for it out-of-pocket to avoid a premium increase and are asking for our blessing. What is our advice?", "keywords": ["direct payment", "no admission of guilt", "liability", "at-fault"], "reference_answer": "We generally advise against this. The policy requires the insured not to voluntarily make any payment or assume any obligation without our written consent. Doing so could jeopardize their coverage and our ability to defend them if the other party later claims injuries.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Voluntary payments without insurer consent may violate policy conditions."}
{"question": "A customer is claiming theft of a $2,500 laptop from a hotel room. They have no receipt but have a photo of it. Is this enough evidence?", "keywords": ["theft", "proof of ownership", "contents inventory", "evidence"], "reference_answer": "Yes, a photo can serve as proof of ownership. However, you should research the current market price for that specific model to determine the ACV and apply any applicable deductibles and policy sub-limits for electronics.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Photos are acceptable documentation for verifying the existence of personal property."}
{"question": "A claimant is reporting 'smoke damage' throughout their home from a bonfire the neighbor had in their yard. Is this covered under fire damage?", "keywords": ["smoke damage", "covered peril", "fire", "homeowners"], "reference_answer": "Typically, no. Homeowners policies generally cover smoke damage when it is sudden and accidental, resulting from a covered fire. Smoke from a neighbor's controlled bonfire is often considered a nuisance or a maintenance issue rather than a covered 'hostile' fire peril.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Incidental smoke from external controlled sources is not usually a covered peril."}
{"question": "An insured's 20-year-old HVAC unit was struck by lightning. The cost to replace it is $8,000. How do I factor in its age?", "keywords": ["depreciation", "ACV", "HVAC", "useful life"], "reference_answer": "If the policy is ACV, you apply depreciation based on its 20-year age and estimated 15-20 year useful life (placing it at residual value). If the policy is RCV, you pay ACV initially and release the balance upon proof of replacement.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Standard valuation procedure for aging mechanical equipment."}
{"question": "Can I accept a digital signature on a $100,000 settlement release form?", "keywords": ["digital signature", "Adobe Sign", "DocuSign", "validation"], "reference_answer": "Yes, as long as it is collected via a company-approved platform (e.g., DocuSign, Adobe Sign) that provides a secure audit trail and tamper-evident seal. Digital signatures are legally binding for settlement releases.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Digital signatures collected through approved secure platforms are contractually and legally valid."}
{"question": "A policyholder's house was vandalized while it was being renovated and they were living elsewhere for 2 weeks. Does the vacancy clause apply?", "keywords": ["vandalism", "vacancy", "occupancy", "30 days"], "reference_answer": "No. A house is not considered vacant if its occupants are only temporarily absent. Since the absence was only 2 weeks and they intended to return, the 30-day vacancy exclusion for vandalism does not trigger.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Temporary absence for renovation does not constitute vacancy under policy definitions."}
{"question": "We found out our insured was using their personal truck to deliver lumber for their side business when they had an accident. Should I pay the claim?", "keywords": ["commercial use", "auto insurance", "exclusion", "side business"], "reference_answer": "The claim should be refused. Standard personal auto policies exclude coverage for any vehicle used for commercial purposes, including delivery of goods for a business, unless a commercial endorsement is active.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Non-disclosed commercial use of a personal vehicle is an excluded activity."}
{"question": "A claimant's dog bit a child. The dog is a Pit Bull, and the policy has a 'Prohibited Breed' endorsement excluding Pit Bulls. Can I deny the claim?", "keywords": ["dog bite", "breed exclusion", "liability", "denial"], "reference_answer": "Yes. If the policy explicitly contains a breed exclusion for Pit Bulls and the incident involved that breed, you should deny the liability claim based on that endorsement.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Specific breed endorsements override general liability coverage for excluded breeds."}
{"question": "An insured wants to be reimbursed for a 5-star hotel stay after a small kitchen fire that only affected the stove area. Should I approve the ALE?", "keywords": ["ALE", "habitable", "Additional Living Expenses", "necessity"], "reference_answer": "You should likely refuse the ALE. ALE is only payable if the dwelling is 'unfit for its intended use' (uninhabitable) due to a covered loss. If the fire was small and the rest of the house is safe and has functional utilities, it is considered habitable.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Additional Living Expenses are only warranted if the home is deemed uninhabitable."}
{"question": "A policyholder's car was totaled. The bank payoff is $15,000, and we paid the ACV of $12,000. They have GAP insurance. Does the GAP policy pay the $3,000?", "keywords": ["GAP insurance", "total loss", "loan payoff", "ACV"], "reference_answer": "Yes. GAP insurance is designed specifically to cover the 'gap' between the vehicle's ACV and the remaining balance on the loan in the event of a total loss.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "GAP insurance exists specifically to fulfill this financial discrepancy."}
{"question": "We are processing a roof replacement. The contractor says the current code requires a specific underlayment that wasn't there before. Should we cover the upgrade cost?", "keywords": ["Ordinance or Law", "code upgrade", "roofing", "endorsement"], "reference_answer": "Only if the policy has an 'Ordinance or Law' or 'Building Code Upgrade' endorsement. Standard policies only pay to restore to pre-loss condition, whereas the code upgrade requires an explicit endorsement.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Coverage for mandated code upgrades is contingent on the presence of a specific policy endorsement."}
{"question": "A claimant sustained a broken leg in an accident and passed away 2 weeks later from a completely unrelated pre-existing heart condition. Do we pay the death benefit under 'Accidental Death'?", "keywords": ["accidental death benefit", "pre-existing condition", "causation", "denial"], "reference_answer": "The Accidental Death Benefit claim should be refused. ADB requires that death result 'directly and independently of all other causes' from the injury. A death from a pre-existing illness is not an accidental death.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "The death was caused by a natural illness, not the accidental injury."}
{"question": "A policyholder's basement flooded during a storm. The water came from the street and through their front door. Is this covered under 'Water Damage'?", "keywords": ["flood", "water damage", "surface water", "exclusion"], "reference_answer": "No. Most homeowners policies define flood as surface water coming from outside the home (like street runoff). This is a standard exclusion and requires a separate flood insurance policy.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Surface water flooding from external sources is an excluded peril in standard homeowners policies."}
{"question": "A claimant's $5,000 camera was stolen from their car. Their policy has a $1,500 theft sub-limit for cameras. How much do I approve for payment?", "keywords": ["theft", "sub-limit", "personal articles", "payout"], "reference_answer": "You approve $1,500 minus their deductible. Standard policies have specific sub-limits for certain high-value categories like jewelry and cameras which cap the payout regardless of the item's actual value.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Payout is restricted by specific category limits defined in the policy."}
{"question": "If an adjuster finds that a claimant had a prior back surgery 3 years ago that they didn't disclose when claiming a 'new focus' back injury from an accident, what should we do?", "keywords": ["concealment", "pre-existing condition", "misrepresentation", "medical records"], "reference_answer": "You should escalate to the SIU for potential material misrepresentation. Knowledge of the prior surgery would have impacted the underwriting of the risk or the assessment of causative damages in the current claim.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Concealment of relevant medical history can be grounds for claim denial or policy rescission."}
{"question": "An insured wants to take their damaged car to their brother's brand-new, unlicensed garage for repairs. Can I approve this?", "keywords": ["repair shop", "licensing", "approved vendor", "policyholder preference"], "reference_answer": "No. Repairs must generally be performed by a licensed repair facility to ensure quality and safety. While they can choose their shop, we only pay for reasonable costs from qualified vendors.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Insurance payouts for repairs generally require the use of licensed and qualified professional facilities."}
{"question": "A travel insurance claimant had to cancel their trip because their cat died. Is this a covered reason?", "keywords": ["trip cancellation", "covered reasons", "pet", "exclusion"], "reference_answer": "No. Standard trip cancellation coverage typically only applies to the death or sickness of the insured, immediate family members, or traveling companions. Pet loss is generally excluded unless a specific pet rider is active.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Pet-related cancellation is not a standard covered event."}
{"question": "A claimant is receiving physical therapy 5 times a week for a minor neck strain. The IME says 2 times a week is standard. Which do I pay?", "keywords": ["physical therapy", "medical necessity", "IME", "excessive treatment"], "reference_answer": "You should pay for 2 sessions a week. Adjusters should only pay for 'medically necessary' treatments. When an Independent Medical Examination (IME) finds a treatment plan excessive, you should adjust the payout to match the medical necessity standard.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Medical payouts are limited to what is determined to be medically necessary."}
{"question": "A policyholder's house was damaged by 'falling objects' when a neighbor's trampoline blew into it. Is this covered?", "keywords": ["falling objects", "peril", "homeowners", "covered damage"], "reference_answer": "Yes. Most homeowners policies cover damage from 'falling objects,' which includes items caught in windstorms that impact the structure.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "The incident falls under the covered peril of falling objects."}
{"question": "An insured wants to be reimbursed for boarding their pet while they stayed in a hotel after a house fire. Is this covered?", "keywords": ["ALE", "pet boarding", "Additional Living Expenses", "covered cost"], "reference_answer": "Yes. If the fire made the home uninhabitable and the temporary housing (hotel) does not allow pets, the cost of boarding the pet is a necessary and reasonable 'Additional Living Expense' (ALE).", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Pet boarding is a valid additional cost incurred due to the loss of habitation."}
{"question": "A claimant is suing our insured for $500,000 for a dog bite. The primary homeowners limit is $300,000. The insured also has a $1 million Umbrella policy. How much is available?", "keywords": ["umbrella policy", "liability limits", "excess coverage", "settlement"], "reference_answer": "A total of $1.3 million is available. The primary policy pays up to its $300,000 limit, and the Umbrella policy provides excess coverage for the remaining $200,000 (and beyond, up to its own $1M limit).", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Umbrella policies provide excess liability on top of primary policy limits."}
{"question": "Can I deny a claim for 'vandalism' if the window was broken by the policyholder's own child having a tantrum?", "keywords": ["vandalism", "intentional act", "insured resident", "exclusion"], "reference_answer": "Yes. Standard policies exclude vandalism or malicious mischief committed by an insured or any resident of the insured household.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Acts committed by household residents are generally excluded from vandalism coverage."}
{"question": "A policyholder wants a 'Replacement Cost' payout for their stolen 10-year-old laptop. The policy is ACV only for personal property. What do I pay?", "keywords": ["ACV", "RCV", "depreciation", "policy terms"], "reference_answer": "You must pay ACV (current replacement cost minus depreciation). Since their policy does not have the RCV endorsement for personal property, you cannot pay the full replacement cost.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "The payout must adhere to the valuation basis specified in the policy contract."}
{"question": "An insured hit a deer. Their deductible is $1,000. The repair bill is $800. Do I pay them anything?", "keywords": ["deductible", "payout", "covered loss", "auto claim"], "reference_answer": "No. The insurer only pays for the portion of a covered loss that exceeds the deductible. Since the loss is less than the deductible, the policyholder is responsible for the full amount.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "The loss amount does not reach the required deductible threshold."}
{"question": "A business lost 3 days of revenue due to a fire. The policy has a 72-hour 'waiting period' for Business Interruption. What is the payout for those 3 days?", "keywords": ["Business Interruption", "waiting period", "deductible", "payout"], "reference_answer": "The payout is $0. The 72-hour waiting period acts as a time-based deductible. Total revenue loss within the first 72 hours of the incident is not covered.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "The loss occurred entirely within the initial non-reimbursable waiting period."}
{"question": "A claimant sustained a broken arm in a slip-and-fall. They didn't see a doctor for 2 months. Can I deny the claim based on the delay?", "keywords": ["medical treatment", "delayed reporting", "causation", "denial"], "reference_answer": "You should investigate for causation issues. A significant gap between the incident and treatment raises questions about whether the injury was actually caused by the incident. While not an automatic denial, it is a major 'red flag.'", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Significant delays in seeking treatment often invalidate the causal link required for coverage."}
{"question": "A policyholder wants to know if their boat policy covers them for a trip to the Bahamas. Their 'navigational limits' are inland and coastal U.S. and Canada. Is it covered?", "keywords": ["boat insurance", "navigational limits", "Bahamas", "exclusion"], "reference_answer": "No. International trips to the Caribbean normally require a specific 'Caribbean Basin' endorsement and prior approval from the insurer.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "The location is geographically outside the standard navigational limits."}
{"question": "An insured's house has a termite infestation. Is the structural damage covered under a standard homeowners policy?", "keywords": ["termite", "neglect", "exclusion", "maintenance"], "reference_answer": "No. Damage from animals, insects, or vermin is a standard exclusion in homeowners policies as it is considered a maintenance issue.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Insect damage is a common exclusion and is generally regarded as a lack of preventative maintenance."}
{"question": "A claimant is reporting 'Mysterious Disappearance' of a diamond ring. There is no sign of a break-in. Is this covered under standard Theft?", "keywords": ["theft", "mysterious disappearance", "unexplained loss", "exclusion"], "reference_answer": "Typically, no. Standard policies require 'observable facts' to suggest a theft occurred. Unexplained disappearances with no evidence of burglary are generally not covered unless a specific floater is active.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Theft coverage usually requires some evidence of theft rather than just a missing item."}
{"question": "A policyholder's basement flooded due to 'hydrostatic pressure' from groundwater after heavy rain. They do not have flood insurance. Is this covered?", "keywords": ["hydrostatic pressure", "groundwater", "exclusion", "water damage"], "reference_answer": "No. Water that exerts pressure on or seeps through a building's foundation or basement from below ground is a standard exclusion under standard homeowners policies.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Underground water pressure is an excluded water damage peril."}
{"question": "An insured's car was totaled. They want us to pay for the 'sentimental value' of the car because it was given to them by their late grandfather. Can I add $2,000 for this?", "keywords": ["ACV", "indemnification", "sentimental value", "valuation"], "reference_answer": "No. The principle of indemnity is to restore the insured to their prior financial position. Sentimental value is subjective and is never included in the Actual Cash Value determination.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Insurance only compensates for objective financial loss, not emotional or sentimental attachment."}
{"question": "A policyholder's roof collapsed due to the 'weight of snow' during a blizzard. Is this a covered peril?", "keywords": ["weighted ice and snow", "covered peril", "homeowners", "collapse"], "reference_answer": "Yes. 'Weight of ice, snow, or sleet' is a named peril in standard HO3 and HO4 policies that provides coverage for structural damage or collapse.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "The event is a standard named peril in property insurance."}
{"question": "A claimant is receiving ' chiropractic treatments' once a week for life for a minor neck strain. The policy has a $10,000 medical limit. Can I cut off payments now that they reached $10,000?", "keywords": ["medical limits", "exhaustion", "payout", "treatment"], "reference_answer": "Yes. Once the policy limit for a specific coverage (like medical payments) is reached, the insurer's financial obligation for that claim under that coverage is exhausted.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "The insurer's liability ends once the contractually agreed-upon dollar limit is paid."}
{"question": "If an adjuster finds that a claimant was texting while driving at the time of an accident, can we deny their own 'Collision' claim?", "keywords": ["Collision", "negligence", "texting while driving", "denial"], "reference_answer": "No. Collision coverage pays for damage to the insured's vehicle regardless of fault, even if the driver was negligent. However, it may impact their future eligibility or premium at renewal.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Collision coverage is a first-party benefit that applies regardless of the insured's negligence."}
{"question": "Is 'War' a covered peril if a policyholder's car is destroyed during a civil riot that turns into an armed conflict?", "keywords": ["war", "riot", "exclusion", "civil commotion"], "reference_answer": "Standard policies cover 'Riot or Civil Commotion' but explicitly exclude 'War' (declared or undeclared). If the authorities classify the event as war, the claim should be denied.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "War is a universal exclusion in standard insurance contracts."}
{"question": "A policyholder wants to know if their boat policy covers their trailer. It's not listed on the declarations page. Is it included?", "keywords": ["boat insurance", "trailer", "policy schedule", "included coverage"], "reference_answer": "No. Trailers must typically be specifically listed and scheduled on the boat policy to be covered for physical damage.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Items must be explicitly named in the policy schedule to receive coverage."}
{"question": "If a claimant's house is damaged by a 'wildfire,' is this covered under 'Fire' damage in a standard policy?", "keywords": ["fire", "wildfire", "covered peril", "homeowners"], "reference_answer": "Yes.

{"question": "A claimant is claiming 'loss of use' for their property because the street was blocked by police for a crime investigation next door. No damage happened to their house. Is this covered?", "keywords": ["loss of use", "BOP", "direct physical loss", "civil authority"], "reference_answer": "Typically, no. Loss of use or business interruption usually requires direct physical damage to insured property. Some policies have limited 'Civil Authority' coverage if access is denied specifically due to damage to nearby property.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Most BI and 'loss of use' coverages require an underlying physical loss."}
{"question": "Can I deny a claim for 'stolen jewelry' if the items were checked into airline luggage rather than carried on?", "keywords": ["theft", "jewelry", "baggage", "exclusion"], "reference_answer": "You should check the policy limits. While not necessarily a denial, many policies have strict sub-limits or even exclusions for high-value jewelry when checked as transit baggage.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Transit exclusions for valuables in checked luggage are common limiting factors."}
{"question": "If an adjuster finds that a claimant had an 'undisclosed roommate' who was driving the car during an accident, can I deny the claim?", "keywords": ["named driver", "undisclosed resident", "exclusion", "auto insurance"], "reference_answer": "This could lead to a denial. Many policies require all licensed drivers in the household to be disclosed. Failure to disclose a regular operator is a material misrepresentation of risk.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Failure to disclose all household drivers is a violation of the application's honesty requirements."}
{"question": "A policyholder's 'Identity Theft' insurance claim is requesting reimbursement for the time they spent missing work to fix their credit. Is this covered?", "keywords": ["identity theft", "lost wages", "expense reimbursement", "covered cost"], "reference_answer": "Check the specific policy. Standard identity theft endorsements often cover lost wages for time taken off to meet with law enforcement or credit bureaus, up to a specific limit (e.g., $250/day).", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Many specialized identity theft endorsements include limited compensation for lost time."}
{"question": "An insured's 5-year-old child drew on the walls with a permanent marker. Is this covered under 'Vandalism'?", "keywords": ["vandalism", "intentional act", "homeowners", "exclusion"], "reference_answer": "No. Standard policies exclude vandalism committed by an insured, which include resident family members. Additionally, damage caused by a child is often excluded as an intentional act or a maintenance issue.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Property damage caused by members of the insured household is not covered under vandalism."}
{"question": "A claimant has a receipt for a $5,000 engagement ring stolen from their unlocked car. Their auto policy has $50,000 comprehensive coverage. Do we pay for the ring?", "keywords": ["theft", "auto insurance", "personal property", "exclusion"], "reference_answer": "No. Auto policies generally do *not* cover personal property stolen from a vehicle. That coverage would typically fall under their Homeowners or Renters insurance policy.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Auto policies cover the vehicle itself, not its contents."}
{"question": "A business owner is claiming for 'Extra Expense' to rent a temporary office after their main building flooded. Is this covered?", "keywords": ["Extra Expense", "BOP", "business interruption", "mitigation"], "reference_answer": "Yes, provided the flood was a covered peril or they had a specific flood endorsement. Extra Expense coverage is designed to pay for costs incurred to continue operations at a temporary location following a covered loss.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Extra Expense is a standard component of major business and property packages."}
{"question": "If an adjuster discovers that an 'injured worker' was actually working a second, physically demanding job while collecting disability benefits, what is the decision?", "keywords": ["fraud", "workers compensation", "disability", "denial"], "reference_answer": "The claim must be denied and referred to the SIU. Working a second job while claiming total disability is definitive workers' compensation fraud.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Engaging in labor while claiming total disability is a criminal misrepresentation."}
{"question": "A claimant's 'Living Benefit' rider allows them to access 50% of their life insurance payout because they were diagnosed with a terminal illness. Should I approve the $250,000 payout?", "keywords": ["accelerated death benefit", "terminal illness", "rider", "death benefit"], "reference_answer": "Yes, if the medical diagnosis is verified by a physician per the rider's requirements. This accelerated payout will reduce the final death benefit paid to beneficiaries later.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Accelerated death benefit riders are designed for this specific medical scenario."}
{"question": "A policyholder's house was damaged when a tree fell on it during a 'controlled burn' they were doing in their backyard. Is this covered?", "keywords": ["controlled burn", "neglect", "exclusion", "fire damage"], "reference_answer": "Probably not. Damages resulting from a fire initiated by the policyholder that violates local ordinances or is deemed negligent are often excluded under the 'Neglect' or 'Intentional Loss' conditions.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Negligent acts involving prohibited burning are typically excluded."}
{"question": "If a claimant's 'Actual Cash Value' for a totaled car is $10,000, and they just put $2,000 worth of new tires and a stereo in it last week, do I increase the payout to $12,000?", "keywords": ["ACV", "vehicle modifications", "betterment", "valuation"], "reference_answer": "Not fully. While enhancements can add value, you don't add the full cost of the parts. You should adjust the ACV based on the *added market value* those items contribute to the car, which is usually significantly less than their cost.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Payout is based on added market value, not dollar-for-dollar cost of upgrades."}
{"question": "An insured wants to take their boat into 'international waters' more than 100 miles offshore for a fishing tournament. Does their standard policy cover this?", "keywords": ["boat insurance", "navigational limits", "international waters", "exclusion"], "reference_answer": "No. Standard boat policies typically have a Navigational Limit of 75 miles offshore. Traveling beyond this requires an 'Extended Coastal' endorsement.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Standard navigational boundaries exclude deep international waters."}
{"question": "A policyholder's 'Jewelry Floater' has a $5,000 ring. It was lost down a drain. Their HO3 policy has a $1,500 theft limit. How much do I pay?", "keywords": ["personal articles floater", "jewelry", "accidental loss", "payout"], "reference_answer": "You pay the full $5,000 value from the floater. Floaters provide broader coverage than standard policies, including accidental loss or mysterious disappearance, often with no deductible.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Personal Article Floaters provide broader, higher-limit coverage than base policies."}
{"question": "Can I deny an auto claim if the policyholder was 'driving for a fee' (e.g. delivering pizzas) but didn't have a commercial policy?", "keywords": ["commercial use", "delivery", "exclusion", "auto insurance"], "reference_answer": "Yes. Most personal auto policies explicitly exclude coverage when the vehicle is being used to carry persons or property for a fee (livery/delivery).", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Commercial delivery is a forbidden activity in a personal auto contract."}
{"question": "A claimant's $10,000 'Whole Life' cash value is being used to pay their delinquent premiums. Is this allowed?", "keywords": ["Whole Life", "cash value", "premium payment", "automatic loan"], "reference_answer": "Yes, if the 'Automatic Premium Loan' option was selected.

{"question": "If a policyholder's house is damaged by 'smog,' is this a covered peril?", "keywords": ["smog", "exclusion", "peril", "homeowners"], "reference_answer": "No. Smog is a standard exclusion in property policies, as it is considered gradual environmental damage/pollution rather than a sudden and accidental event.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Environmental pollutants like smog are standard exclusions."}
{"question": "A claimant's 'Pet Insurance' claim for a $3,000 surgery is being denied because the condition was 'pre-existing.' They say they didn't know about it. Does that matter?", "keywords": ["pre-existing condition", "pet insurance", "exclusion", "veterinary"], "reference_answer": "No. If medical records show symptoms existed or were noted by a vet before the policy was active, it is excluded as pre-existing, regardless of when the owner became aware of it.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Pet insurance excludes conditions that originated prior to the policy's effective date."}
{"question": "An insured wants to take their 'Assigned Risk' auto policy to another state. Is the coverage still valid?", "keywords": ["Assigned Risk", "reciprocity", "territory", "auto insurance"], "reference_answer": "The coverage applies within the U.S. and Canada. However, if they move permanently, they must notify the insurer and apply for a new policy in their new state of residence.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Coverage territory is standard, but permanent residency changes require new contracts."}
{"question": "Can I approve a settlement for 'Bodily Injury' if the only evidence is the claimant's own verbal testimony and no medical bills?", "keywords": ["bodily injury", "evidence", "medical bills", "settlement"], "reference_answer": "No. You should not approve a BI payout without objective medical evidence (e.g., records, bills) clearly linking the injury to the covered incident.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Payouts for injury require objective medical documentation."}
{"question": "A policyholder's roof leaked because the 'gutters were clogged' with leaves they haven't cleaned in 2 years. Is the interior damage covered?", "keywords": ["gutters", "neglect", "exclusion", "water damage"], "reference_answer": "Typically, no. The 'Neglect' exclusion applies.

{"question": "A claimant is reporting 'Arson' for their own business. The fire started in the locked manager's office. Should I refer this to SIU?", "keywords": ["arson", "fraud indicators", "SIU", "suspicion"], "reference_answer": "Yes. Arson, especially when there are signs of internal origin in a secured area, is a mandatory SIU referral for fraud investigation.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Suspected internal arson is a severe fraud indicator."}
{"question": "If a claimant's policy has a 1% 'Hurricane Deductible' and their $300,000 house has $5,000 in storm damage, do we pay anything?", "keywords": ["deductible", "hurricane", "payout", "homeowners"], "reference_answer": "No. The 1% deductible is $3,000. While the damage ($5,000) exceeds the deductible, you only pay the amount *over* it ($2,000). (Correction: In the prompt's context, if the question asks if we pay, the answer is Yes, but the payout is only $2,000).", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Payout is the net amount after subtracting the required high-peril deductible."}
{"question": "A policyholder's daughter's college dorm room was broken into and her $2,000 laptop was stolen. Is this covered under her parents' standard HO3 policy?", "keywords": ["homeowners", "personal property", "off-premises", "student"], "reference_answer": "Yes. Personal property of a full-time student (under 24) living away from home is typically covered up to a specific sub-limit (often 10% of total property coverage).", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Dependent property away from the primary location is a standard extension of HO3 policies."}
{"question": "An insured wants us to pay for their 'attorney fees' for a simple property damage claim negotiation because they 'didn't want to handle it themselves.' Is this covered?", "keywords": ["legal fees", "covered costs", "property damage", "negotiation"], "reference_answer": "No. While the insurer pays for defense counsel if the insured is sued, it does not pay for the insured's own personal attorney used for standard first-party claim negotiations.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "First-party negotiation costs are the sole responsibility of the policyholder."}
{"question": "A business is claiming for 'Extra Expense' to expedite the shipping of new materials after a fire. Is this a covered cost?", "keywords": ["Extra Expense", "expediting", "BOP", "mitigation"], "reference_answer": "Yes. Reasonable expenses incurred to minimize the 'period of restoration' or business downtime are covered under the Extra Expense provision.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Expediting costs to reduce overall loss are a standard included benefit."}
{"question": "If an adjuster finds that a claimant had 'no driver's license' at the time of an accident, can we deny their liability claim?", "keywords": ["licensing", "auto insurance", "exclusion", "liability"], "reference_answer": "Potentially. Most policies require operators to be 'legally authorized' to drive. Operating without a valid license may violate policy conditions and lead to a denial.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Operating a vehicle while unlicensed is a violation of mandatory policy conditions."}
{"question": "A claimant's 'Medical Payments' coverage has a 3-year time limit for incurring expenses. They are submitting a bill for a treatment done 4 years after the accident. Do I pay it?", "keywords": ["MedPay", "time limit", "exclusion", "medical bills"], "reference_answer": "No. The policy explicitly limits coverage to medical expenses incurred within three years of the date of the accident.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "The claim is submitted beyond the contractually defined time limit for coverage."}
{"question": "An insured wants to total their own car after a minor accident because they 'just don't feel safe in it anymore.' The repair cost is only $2,000 and the ACV is $20,000. Do I agree?", "keywords": ["total loss", "subjective safe", "valuation", "auto claim"], "reference_answer": "No. A vehicle is only totaled if the repair cost meets the objective threshold (e.g., 75% of ACV). Personal feelings about safety do not trigger a total loss declaration.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Total loss declarations are based on objective financial and safety criteria, not subjective preference."}
{"question": "Is 'Theft' covered if the items were taken from a vehicle, boat, or RV that was NOT on the insured premises?", "keywords": ["theft", "personal property", "off-premises", "exclusion"], "reference_answer": "It depends. Personal property away from the premises is covered, but theft *from* a vehicle/boat not at the home is often specifically excluded unless a specialized 'Personal Property Away From Premises' endorsement is present.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Standard theft coverage for property in vehicles often requires the vehicle to be on the primary premises."}
{"question": "A policyholder's house was damaged by 'falling objects' when a branch from a dead tree fell on it. They had been warned by the city to remove the tree 6 months ago. Is this covered?", "keywords": ["falling objects", "neglect", "refusal", "homeowners"], "reference_answer": "This could be denied under the 'Neglect' exclusion. The policyholder failed to use all reasonable means to save and preserve the property by ignoring a known hazard they were warned about.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "The failure to address a documented hazardous condition constitutes neglect."}
{"question": "A claimant is receiving 'lost wages' for a week they spent on a pre-planned vacation while they were supposed to be recovering. Should I pay those days?", "keywords": ["lost wages", "fraud", "disability", "excessive claim"], "reference_answer": "No. Lost wage compensation is only for actual time unable to work due to the injury. Using that time for personal recreation suggests they were not truly disabled and may constitute misrepresentation.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Compensation is only for periods of actual functional disability from work."}
{"question": "If a policyholder's 'Whole Life' policy has been in force for 5 years, can they still be denied for a misrepresentation on the original application?", "keywords": ["Whole Life", "incontestability", "misrepresentation", "2 years"], "reference_answer": "No, generally.

{"question": "Can I deny a claim for 'accidental breakage' of a fragile porcelain vase under a standard HO3 policy?", "keywords": ["fragile articles", "breakage", "exclusion", "homeowners"], "reference_answer": "Yes.

{"question": "Is 'Sudden and Accidental' water damage covered if the dishwasher's internal components just 'wore out' and leaked?", "keywords": ["maintenance", "wear and tear", "exclusion", "water damage"], "reference_answer": "No. Damage caused by 'wear and tear' or lack of maintenance of appliances is a standard exclusion.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Ordinary mechanical failure and wear are excluded from insurance coverage."}
{"question": "A policyholder's 'Term Life' policy was reinstated 6 months ago. They just committed suicide. Do I pay the death benefit?", "keywords": ["suicide clause", "reinstatement", "term life", "exclusion"], "reference_answer": "No. When a policy is reinstated, the 2-year suicide exclusion period often resets from the reinstatement date. Since the death occurred within that period, the payout is limited to a refund of premiums.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Suicide within two years of policy reinstatement is an excluded event."}
{"question": "If a claimant's house is damaged by an 'earthquake,' is this covered under a standard HO3 policy?", "keywords": ["earthquake", "earth movement", "exclusion", "homeowners"], "reference_answer": "No. 'Earth Movement' is a standard exclusion in homeowner policies and requires a separate earthquake policy or endorsement.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Earthquake is a major excluded peril in standard property contracts."}
{"question": "Can I withhold 'depreciation' on a roof replacement claim until the work is actually finished?", "keywords": ["RCV", "depreciation holdback", "payout", "homeowners"], "reference_answer": "Yes. This is standard procedure for Replacement Cost Value (RCV) policies. You pay ACV upfront and release the withheld depreciation once proof of completion is submitted.", "final_decision": "approval", "reason": "Withholding depreciation until work completion is a contractually allowed safeguard."}
{"question": "An insured wants to take their 'Assigned Risk' car to Mexico for a weekend. Is the coverage still in effect?", "keywords": ["territory", "Mexico", "auto insurance", "exclusion"], "reference_answer": "No. Most auto policies, including Assigned Risk, define the coverage territory as the U.S., its territories, and Canada. Trips to Mexico are generally excluded.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "The location is outside the geographically defined coverage territory."}
{"question": "A policyholder's house was damaged when neighbor's 'vandalism' fire spread to it. Our insured was on vacation. Is this covered?", "keywords": ["fire", "vandalism", "covered peril", "homeowners"], "reference_answer": "Yes.

{"question": "Can I deny a 'Medical Payments' claim if the claimant was injured more than 3 years ago but just decided to go to physical therapy now?", "keywords": ["MedPay", "time limit", "exclusion", "injury"], "reference_answer": "Yes.

Is the cost to repair it covered under their homeowners policy?", "keywords": ["mechanical breakdown", "wear and tear", "refrigerator", "exclusion"], "reference_answer": "No. Mechanical breakdown and wear and tear are standard exclusions.

{"question": "A claimant is claiming for 'lost jewelry' from an unlocked vehicle. They don't have a police report but have a video of them looking for it. Is this covered?", "keywords": ["theft", "unsecured vehicle", "police report", "exclusion"], "reference_answer": "Typically, no.

{"question": "A policyholder's house was damaged when a 'sinkhole' opened up under their backyard.

Is the roof repair and interior painting covered?", "keywords": ["wear and tear", "leak", "exclusion", "maintenance"], "reference_answer": "No. Standard rain is not a covered peril for roof damage.

{"question": "If a claimant's 'Actual Cash Value' for a totaled car is $5,000, but they owe $8,000 on the loan and DON'T have GAP insurance, what is our payout?", "keywords": ["total loss", "ACV", "payout", "underwater loan"], "reference_answer": "Our payout is $5,000 (minus deductible).

{"question": "A policyholder's house was damaged by 'mold' after a covered pipe burst. They waited 3 weeks to report it or start drying. Is the mold cleanup covered?", "keywords": ["mold", "neglect", "exclusion", "mitigation"], "reference_answer": "Probably not. The policyholder has a duty to mitigate loss. Failing to report/dry the area for 3 weeks constitutes neglect, which likely caused the mold growth.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Failure to mitigate preventable secondary damage is grounds for exclusion."}
{"question": "Can I deny an auto claim for 'intentional damage' if the policyholder drove their car through their ex-spouse's front door?", "keywords": ["intentional loss", "auto insurance", "exclusion", "liability"], "reference_answer": "Yes.

{"question": "If a policyholder's car is destroyed by 'lightning,' is this covered under 'Collision' coverage?", "keywords": ["lightning", "auto insurance", "peril", "Collision"], "reference_answer": "No. Lightning is a non-collision peril covered under 'Comprehensive' coverage.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "The cause of loss falls under a different specific coverage category."}
{"question": "Can I withhold 'sales tax' on a total loss vehicle payout if the policyholder hasn't bought a new car yet?", "keywords": ["total loss", "sales tax", "valuation", "auto claim"], "reference_answer": "This depends on state law.

Do I pay for those sessions?", "keywords": ["MMI", "medical necessity", "payout", "treatment"], "reference_answer": "No. Once a patient reaches Maximum Medical Improvement (MMI), additional therapy is generally not considered 'medically necessary' for the injury improvement.", "final_decision": "refusal", "reason": "Treatment beyond MMI does not meet the standard for restorative medical necessity."}

{"question": "A claimant is claiming for 'theft' of a $10,000 diamond ring that was accidentally left on a park bench. Is this covered?", "keywords": ["theft", "mysterious disappearance", "unexplained loss", "exclusion"], "reference_answer": "The claim would likely be refused or limited.
