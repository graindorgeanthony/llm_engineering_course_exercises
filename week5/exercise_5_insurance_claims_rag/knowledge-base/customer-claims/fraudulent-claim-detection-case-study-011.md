# Fraudulent Claim Detection Case Study 011: Suspicious Flood Damage Claim

## Overview
This case study details the detection, investigation, and resolution of a suspected fraudulent property damage claim (Claim ID: C-2023-FD-011) submitted by a policyholder for alleged flood damage. The objective of this document is to illustrate the red flags identified, the investigative steps taken, and the criteria used to classify the claim as fraudulent, serving as a reference for future fraud detection efforts.

## Scope
This document covers the entire lifecycle of Claim ID C-2023-FD-011, from initial submission to final dismissal due to substantiated fraud. It includes initial assessment, investigation protocols, evidence collected, and the decision-making process. It *does not* cover subsequent legal actions taken against the policyholder, which fall under a separate legal department process.

## Definitions
*   **Policyholder (PH):** Janet C. Peterson
*   **Claim ID:** C-2023-FD-011
*   **Date of Loss (DOL):** December 10, 2022
*   **Date Reported:** December 12, 2022
*   **Adjuster:** Sarah K. Lewis (Employee ID: 45678)
*   **Special Investigations Unit (SIU):** Department responsible for investigating suspected fraudulent claims.
*   **Peril:** The cause of loss covered by the insurance policy (e.g., flood, fire, theft).
*   **Red Flag:** An indicator or characteristic that suggests a higher likelihood of fraud.

## Claim Narrative
On December 12, 2022, Policyholder Janet C. Peterson submitted a claim for significant water damage to her primary residence located at 123 Oakwood Lane, Springfield, IL 62704. The stated Date of Loss was December 10, 2022, attributing the damage to an "unexpected basement flood" caused by heavy rainfall. The claim included a preliminary estimate for repairs totaling $48,500 and a list of damaged personal property, including electronics, furniture, and antique books, valued at an additional $15,000.

## Initial Assessment and Red Flags Identified
Upon initial review by Adjuster Sarah K. Lewis, several red flags were noted which triggered a referral to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) within 24 hours of claim intake (December 13, 2022):

1.  **"Quick Claim" Submission:** The claim was filed just two days after the alleged Date of Loss, with a detailed estimate already prepared. While not inherently suspicious, combined with other factors, it warrants scrutiny.
2.  **Recent Policy Inception:** The property insurance policy for 123 Oakwood Lane was relatively new, having been purchased on October 15, 2022, only two months prior to the alleged loss.
3.  **No Public Record of Weather Event:** A preliminary check of local weather reports for Springfield, IL, for December 9-11, 2022, showed moderate rainfall, but no record of severe weather or widespread flooding that would typically cause significant basement damage in that area. The National Weather Service (NWS) report for December 10, 2022, indicated 0.7 inches of rain, well below flood thresholds.
4.  **High-Value, Easily Portable Personal Property:** The list of damaged personal property included several high-value items (e.g., "vintage vinyl collection," "first edition hardcover books") that are often cited in fraudulent claims due to their ease of disposal and subjective valuation.
5.  **PH Resistance to Preferred Vendors:** During the initial call, the PH expressed strong preference for using her own contractors for repairs and seemed hesitant to allow the insurer's preferred water mitigation company access to the property quickly.

## Investigation Procedure
Upon SIU referral, the following investigative steps were initiated:

### 1. Site Inspection and Water Damage Analysis (December 15, 2022)
*   **Action:** SIU Investigator Mark D. Jensen and an independent forensic water damage expert (HydroSolutions, Inc., Expert ID: HRW789) conducted a site visit.
*   **Findings:**
    *   Water lines observed in the basement were inconsistent with a single, sudden flood event. They appeared to be artificially aged or created over time.
    *   No visible signs of water ingress from external sources (e.g., foundation cracks, blocked drains, sump pump failure).
    *   Relative humidity readings in unaffected areas of the house (first floor) were normal (45%), while basement readings were elevated (78%), but without the characteristic "musty" odor consistent with prolonged or high-volume flooding.
    *   The expert noted the absence of typical secondary damage (e.g., swelled baseboards, warped flooring on upper levels, specific mold patterns) that would correspond to a severe external flood.
    *   A small external hose spigot in the backyard appeared recently used, indicating a possible internal water source for the damage.

### 2. Interview with Policyholder (December 17, 2022)
*   **Action:** Recorded interview conducted by SIU Investigator Mark D. Jensen.
*   **Key Discrepancies/Responses:**
    *   When questioned about the lack of external evidence for flooding, PH became defensive and vague, stating "it just came up from the ground."
    *   PH could not provide specific details about the onset of the flooding or describe the immediate aftermath coherently.
    *   PH acknowledged having financial difficulties in the months prior to the claim, mentioning a recent job loss, which was later confirmed.

### 3. Review of Past Claim History (December 14, 2022)
*   **Action:** Database search of PH and associated addresses.
*   **Findings:** PH Janet C. Peterson had filed two previous property claims with other carriers within the last five years, both involving water damage to a basement in different properties. One claim (Carrier X, Claim ID: 2019-W-4587) was denied due to "insufficient evidence of covered peril," and another (Carrier Y, Claim ID: 2021-WD-1122) was settled for a significantly reduced amount after an investigation. This pattern indicated a history of suspicious water damage claims.

### 4. Financial Records Analysis (December 20, 2022)
*   **Action:** PH's credit report and public financial disclosures were reviewed (with consent as per policy).
*   **Findings:** Confirmed PH’s recent unemployment (terminated November 20, 2022) and significant unsecured debt ($35,000 in credit card debt, two missed mortgage payments in the last four months). These findings established a strong financial motive for fraud.

## Decision Logic and Final Classification
Based on the cumulative evidence, the following decision criteria were met:

*   **Discrepancy between Alleged Loss and Physical Evidence:** Forensic analysis contradicted PH's account of a sudden, severe external flood. The observed damage pattern was indicative of a localized, potentially deliberate water introduction, likely from an internal source over time.
*   **Lack of External Causal Event:** Public weather data unequivocally showed no significant rainfall or flooding events in the area on the Date of Loss.
*   **Behavioral Red Flags:** PH's defensiveness, vague responses during interviews, and reluctance to cooperate with standard procedures.
*   **Prior Claims History:** A pattern of suspicious water damage claims with other insurers.
*   **Strong Financial Motive:** Documented significant financial distress and recent unemployment.

## Conclusion and Resolution
On January 15, 2023, based on the unanimous recommendation of the SIU, Claim ID C-2023-FD-011 was formally classified as **fraudulent**. The claim was denied in full. The policyholder was notified of the decision and the reasons for denial via certified mail. The case, including all gathered evidence, was referred to the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) for further action. A detailed report was also submitted to the state Department of Insurance anti-fraud unit as required by law.
