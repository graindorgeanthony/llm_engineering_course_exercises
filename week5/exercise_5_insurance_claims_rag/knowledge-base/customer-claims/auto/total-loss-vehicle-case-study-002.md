# Auto Total Loss Vehicle Case Study 002

## Overview
This document details Case Study 002 for an auto insurance total loss claim. It provides a comprehensive record of the claim process from initial notification to final settlement, including vehicle valuation, salvage operations, and indemnification determination. The purpose is to serve as a reference for agents handling similar total loss scenarios, demonstrating a typical workflow and decision-making process.

## Scope
This case study applies to claims involving passenger vehicles declared a total loss due to collision damage where the cost of repair exceeds the Actual Cash Value (ACV) or a predefined percentage of ACV. It covers standard valuation techniques, salvage procedures, and payout calculations for insured vehicles. Excluded are claims involving theft, fire-only losses, or commercial vehicles.

## Definitions
*   **Actual Cash Value (ACV):** The fair market value of the vehicle immediately before the loss, considering factors like age, mileage, condition, and options.
*   **Total Loss Threshold:** The point at which a vehicle is deemed uneconomical to repair. For State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, this is typically when repair costs reach or exceed 75% of the ACV.
*   **Salvage Value:** The amount that can be recovered from selling the damaged vehicle for parts or scrap.
*   **Indemnification:** The principle of restoring the insured to their financial position prior to the loss, without profiting from the loss.
*   **CCC Information Services (CCC One):** A commonly used third-party valuation service providing market-driven ACV reports.

## Vehicle Valuation

### Valuation Methodology

### Valuation Report Details
**Date of Valuation:** November 1, 2023
**Valuation Source:** CCC Information Services Report ID: SF-2023-11-002
**Key Comparables Used:**
    *   **Comparable 1:** 2018 Honda Civic EX, 62,500 miles, similar options, sold 10/25/2023 for $21,000 (Local Dealer: Auto Emporium)
    *   **Comparable 2:** 2018 Honda Civic EX, 68,000 miles, similar options, sold 10/20/2023 for $20,500 (Private Sale: Online Classifieds)
    *   **Comparable 3:** 2018 Honda Civic EX, 65,000 miles, slightly higher mileage, sold 10/22/2023 for $20,800 (Local Dealer: CarZone)

**Adjustments for Insured Vehicle (Mr. Jenkins' 2018 Honda Civic EX):**
*   **Mileage:** 63,000 miles (average of comparables: 65,166 miles) – No significant adjustment.
*   **Condition:** Rated "Good" prior to loss based on photos and policyholder statement (minor scratches consistent with age, no major dents). Comparables ranged from "Good" to "Very Good."
*   **Options:** Standard EX trim package, no aftermarket modifications.
*   **Pre-Loss photos:** Policyholder provided photos from 6 months prior, showing well-maintained condition.

**Calculated Actual Cash Value (ACV):**
*   Base ACV (from CCC One): $20,750.00
*   Sales Tax (6.0% for California): $1,245.00
*   License & Title Fees: $75.00
*   **Total ACV:** **$22,070.00**

### Initial Repair Estimate
**Date of Estimate:** October 31, 2023
**Estimating Source:** Springfield Auto Body & Towing (using CCC One Estimating Software)
**Estimated Repair Cost:** $17,500.00
**Total Loss Threshold Check:** $17,500.00 (Repair Cost) / $20,750.00 (Base ACV) = 84.34%

## Total Loss Determination

**Decision Date:** November 2, 2023
**Decision Maker:** Adjuster Michael Vance
**Decision Logic:** Since the estimated repair cost of $17,500.00 exceeds the company's total loss threshold of 75% of the vehicle's ACV ($20,750.00 * 0.75 = $15,562.50), the vehicle was declared a total loss.

**Salvage Pickup:** Vehicle was released from Springfield Auto Body & Towing and picked up by IAA on November 3, 2023.

*   **Date of Payout:** November 15, 2023
*   **Additional Payments:**

    *   Tow Bill Directly to Springfield Auto Body & Towing: $150.00 *Paid directly by insurer on 11/01/23.*

### Lienholder Information
*   **Lienholder:** First National Bank

    *   $6,570.00 sent to Mr. Arthur P. Jenkins
