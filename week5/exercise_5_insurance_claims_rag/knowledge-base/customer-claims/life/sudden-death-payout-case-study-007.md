## Claim Narrative

On November 10, 2022, our Claims Department received notification of the death of Mr. Alexander J. Thompson, policyholder of LI-12345678-SD. The notification was submitted by Mrs. Eleanor Thompson, who identified herself as the surviving spouse and primary beneficiary. Initial policy records listed "Spouse, Eleanor Thompson" with no specific date of birth or social security number (SSN) for the beneficiary. The policy was issued in 2005.

Further investigation revealed that Mr. Thompson had divorced his first wife, Eleanor Thompson, in 2010 and subsequently remarried a Ms. Eleanor M. Davis in 2012, who legally changed her name to Eleanor M. Thompson. The policyholder had not updated his beneficiary designation after his remarriage.

## Procedures Followed

1.  **Claim Initiation (2022-11-10):** Initial claim filed via online portal by Mrs. Eleanor Thompson (second wife).
2.  **Document Collection (2022-11-10 to 2022-11-15):**
    *   Official Death Certificate for Mr. Alexander J. Thompson received.
    *   Claimant Statement Form received from Mrs. Eleanor Thompson (second wife).
    *   Identification documents for Mrs. Eleanor Thompson (second wife) received.
3.  **Beneficiary Identification Challenge (2022-11-16):**
    *   Claims Adjuster, Sarah Jenkins, initiated a review.
    *   Noticed discrepancy: Policy stated "Spouse, Eleanor Thompson" but did not include specific identifying details for the named individual. Records indicated a prior spouse with the same name.
4.  **Verification of Marital History (2022-11-17 to 2022-11-28):**
    *   Contacted Mrs. Eleanor Thompson (second wife) for marriage certificate to Mr. Alexander J. Thompson. Received copy of marriage certificate dated 2012-07-20.
    *   Performed public records search (with claimant's consent) for Mr. Alexander J. Thompson's marital history. Uncovered divorce decree from 2010 naming Eleanor S. Thompson (first wife) as the former spouse.
    *   Contacted estate attorney for Mr. Alexander J. Thompson, Mr. Robert Peterson, for clarification on testamentary documents or divorce decrees pertaining to beneficiary designations. Attorney confirmed no specific life insurance beneficiary changes were made in Mr. Thompson's will.
5.  **Legal Review (2022-11-29 to 2022-12-15):**
    *   Case escalated to Legal Department for interpretation of beneficiary designation.
    *   Legal opinion: In absence of specific unique identifiers (DOB, SSN) and given the policy's designation of "spouse," the current legal spouse at the time of death is typically considered the intended beneficiary, especially when no former spouse is explicitly named after a divorce.
    *   Review of policy language: Section 7.2, "Beneficiary Designation," states: "If a beneficiary is designated by relationship only (e.g., 'spouse,' 'children'), the individual(s) holding that relationship at the time of the Insured's death shall be deemed the beneficiary(ies)."
6.  **Confirmation and AML/KYC (2022-12-16 to 2022-12-20):**
    *   Based on legal review and gathered evidence, Mrs. Eleanor M. Thompson (second wife) was confirmed as the rightful beneficiary.
    *   Standard AML/KYC checks performed on Mrs. Eleanor M. Thompson. All checks passed.
7.  **Payout Approval (2022-12-21):**
    *   Claim approved for payout by Claims Manager, David Chen.
8.  **Disbursement (2023-01-15):**
    *   Payout of $500,000 USD executed via wire transfer to Mrs. Eleanor M. Thompson's verified bank account. The delay from approval was due to standard bank processing times.

## Decision Logic

*   **Initial Beneficiary Conflict:** When a named beneficiary is identified only by relationship (e.g., "spouse") and a discrepancy arises due to divorce and remarriage, further investigation is mandatory.
*   **Primary Evidence for "Spouse" Designation:**
    1.  Valid marriage certificate between the policyholder and the claimant, dated prior to the policyholder's death.
    2.  Official divorce decree(s) to verify marital status history.
    3.  Policy language interpretation regarding "relationship-based" beneficiary designations.
*   **Resolution:** In this case, the policy language (Section 7.2) explicitly supported the interpretation that the current legal spouse at the time of death, Mrs. Eleanor M. Thompson, was the intended beneficiary, overriding the historical naming discrepancy. No evidence suggested a specific intent to retain the former spouse as beneficiary, and the term "Spouse" was general.

## Evidence/Documentation Required
*   Official Death Certificate (Mr. Alexander J. Thompson)
*   Claimant Statement Form (Mrs. Eleanor M. Thompson)
*   Beneficiary Identification (Driver's License, Passport for Mrs. Eleanor M. Thompson)
*   Marriage Certificate (Mr. Alexander J. Thompson and Mrs. Eleanor M. Thompson, dated 2012-07-20)
*   Divorce Decree (Mr. Alexander J. Thompson and ex-wife Eleanor S. Thompson, dated 2010-09-01)
*   Legal Department Opinion Memo (Case SD-LI-2022-007, dated 2022-12-15)
*   AML/KYC Compliance Report (Mrs. Eleanor M. Thompson)

## Timelines
*   **Claim Notification:** 1 day post-death
*   **Document Collection:** 5 business days
*   **Beneficiary Verification & Legal Review:** 20 business days
*   **Claim Approval:** 1 business day post-verification
*   **Payout:** 10 business days post-approval (standard bank transfer period)

## Exceptions
No exceptions were granted in this case. All standard verification and legal review processes were strictly adhered to due to the beneficiary identification challenge. Had a specific beneficiary (e.g., "Eleanor S. Thompson, former spouse") been explicitly named post-divorce or in a will, the decision logic would have shifted to honor the specific designation or address potential conflicting instruments.

## Key Learnings
*   The importance of clear beneficiary designations on policies, including full names, dates of birth, and Social Security Numbers, to prevent future ambiguities.
*   Robust procedures for verifying marital status when "spouse" is the sole descriptor, especially in cases involving divorce and remarriage.
*   The necessity of legal counsel interpretation when beneficiary designations are ambiguous or challenged.
*   Regular policy reviews should be encouraged for policyholders to update beneficiary information following major life events (e.g., divorce, marriage, birth of children).
