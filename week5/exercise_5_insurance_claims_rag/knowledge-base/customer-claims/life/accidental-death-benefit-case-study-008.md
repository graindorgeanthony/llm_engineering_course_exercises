# Life Accidental Death Benefit Case Study 008

## Overview
This document details the investigation and adjudication of a claim for Accidental Death Benefit (ADB) under policy number LI-987654321, subsequent to the primary life insurance payout. The case involves a thorough review of the cause of death as determined by medical and law enforcement reports, specifically focusing on the applicability of the accidental death clause and potential exclusions.

## Claim Summary
*   **Policyholder Name:** Mr. John A. Smith
*   **Policy Number:** LI-987654321
*   **Date of Death:** December 10, 2022
*   **Date of Claim Submission:** December 28, 2022
*   **Cause of Death (Initial Report):** Fall from height, multiple blunt force traumas
*   **Primary Beneficiary:** Ms. Jane Smith (Spouse)
*   **Standard Death Benefit Payout:** $500,000 (Paid on January 10, 2023)
*   **Accidental Death Benefit Applied For:** $500,000 (Double Indemnity)

## Scope
This case study covers the investigation specific to the Accidental Death Benefit rider attached to policy LI-987654321. It analyzes medical, police, and toxicology reports to determine if the death qualifies as "accidental" as defined by the policy, and evaluates against common exclusions such as suicide, self-inflicted injury, or death resulting from illegal acts. The standard life insurance death benefit payout is outside the scope of this particular review.

## Definitions
*   **Accidental Death Benefit (ADB):** A rider that provides an additional payout, typically double the face amount, if the insured's death is directly caused by an accident, as defined by the policy.
*   **Accident:** An unforeseen and unintended event that is external to the insured, and which results in bodily injury or death independently of any other cause.
*   **Self-inflicted Injury Exclusion:** Policy clause stating no benefit is payable if death results directly or indirectly from intentionally self-inflicted injury, while sane or insane.
*   **Intoxication Exclusion:** Policy clause stating no benefit is payable if death results from being under the influence of drugs or alcohol, if such intoxication was a contributing cause of death.
*   **Forensic Toxicology:** Analysis of biological samples to detect and quantify drugs, alcohol, or poisons.

## Claim Narrative
On December 28, 2022, Ms. Jane Smith, the primary beneficiary, submitted a claim for both the standard death benefit and the Accidental Death Benefit Rider following the death of her husband, Mr. John A. Smith. The initial police report and death certificate listed the cause of death as "multiple blunt force traumas due to fall from rooftop," classified as "accidental" by the local police department.

## Investigation and Evidence Collection

### Evidence/Documentation Collected:
1.  **Death Certificate:** Issued December 15, 2022, by Dr. Evelyn Reed, listing cause of death as "multiple blunt force traumas," manner of death as "accident."
2.  **Police Report (Case #PD-2022-1210-001):** Dated December 10, 2022, from Central City Police Department. States Mr. Smith was found deceased at the base of a 5-story commercial building at approximately 03:30 AM. No witnesses. Access to the building rooftop was via an unsecured maintenance ladder. No signs of struggle or forced entry. Officers observed an empty whiskey bottle and prescription pill bottle (Ambien) near the body.
3.  **Coroner's Report (Autopsy #2022-AD-007):** Dated December 18, 2022, by Dr. Lena Khan, County Medical Examiner. Confirmed cause of death as multiple blunt force traumas consistent with a fall from a significant height. Noted presence of significant ethanol (blood alcohol content 0.21%) and Zolpidem (Ambien) in post-mortem toxicology screening.
4.  **Forensic Toxicology Report (Lab Ref: TX-2022-0098):** Detailed analysis confirming BAC of 0.21% and therapeutic to slightly elevated levels of Zolpidem. Report noted that this combination could lead to severe impairment, disorientation, and loss of coordination.
5.  **Policy Terms and Conditions:** Section 6, Accidental Death Benefit Rider, specifically detailing exclusions for self-inflicted injury, illegal acts, and death resulting from impairment due to drugs/alcohol.

## Analysis and Decision Logic

### Criteria for ADB Payout:
1.  Death must be a direct result of an accident.
2.  Death must occur within 90 days of the accident.
3.  Death must not fall under any policy exclusions.

### Evaluation Against Policy Criteria:
*   **Direct Result of Accident:** The medical examiner and police report confirm the death resulted from a fall, which can be interpreted as an accidental event. However, the contributing factors are crucial.
*   **Policy Exclusions - Suicide/Self-Inflicted Injury:** The police report found no evidence of a suicide note, struggle, or forced entry, which might suggest an accidental fall rather than an intentional act. However, the high levels of alcohol and Zolpidem complicate this. The policy defines "self-inflicted injury" broadly, including actions taken while 'insane' or 'under the influence'.
*   **Policy Exclusions - Intoxication:** The toxicology report indicates a BAC of 0.21% and presence of Zolpidem. This level of intoxication is legally impaired and medically recognized to cause severe disorientation, impaired judgment, and loss of coordination, making a fall highly probable. The policy states, "no benefit shall be payable if death results directly or indirectly from the Insured being under the influence of alcohol or any intoxicant."

### Decision Logic Flow:
1.  **Is the death accidental by initial appearance?** Yes, fall from height.
2.  **Are there any contributing factors?** Yes, severe alcohol and drug intoxication.
3.  **Do these factors fall under policy exclusions?** Review of Policy Section 6.2(d) "Death resulting directly or indirectly from the Insured being under the influence of alcohol or any intoxicant."
4.  **Was the intoxication a direct or indirect cause of the fall?** Given the BAC of 0.21% and presence of Zolpidem, it is medically and legally unreasonable to conclude that intoxication was not a significant contributing factor to Mr. Smith's disorientation and subsequent fall from an unsecured rooftop access. The fall itself, while an "event," is not isolated from the context of severe impairment.

## Decision
Based on the thorough review of all submitted documentation, particularly the Coroner’s Report and Forensic Toxicology Report, it has been determined that Mr. John A. Smith's death, while an accident in terms of the immediate event (the fall), was directly and indirectly caused by his severe intoxication. The blood alcohol content of 0.21% combined with Zolpidem levels would have significantly impaired his judgment, coordination, and awareness, leading to the fatal fall from the rooftop.

This situation falls squarely within the "Intoxication Exclusion" clause (Section 6.2(d)) of the Accidental Death Benefit Rider of policy LI-987654321, which explicitly states that no benefit is payable if death results directly or indirectly from the insured being under the influence of alcohol or any intoxicant.

Therefore, the claim for Accidental Death Benefit is DENIED.

## Exceptions
No exceptions are applicable in this case, as the intoxication clause is clear and the evidence of severe impairment is unequivocal. There were no extenuating circumstances or third-party involvement suggested by the police investigation.

## Recommended Action
*   Send a formal denial letter to the beneficiary, Ms. Jane Smith, clearly citing the specific policy exclusion and providing a summary of the evidence used to reach this decision (Coroner's Report, Toxicology Report).
*   Offer an opportunity for the beneficiary to appeal the decision within 60 days, requiring new evidence that contradicts the findings of severe intoxication as a contributing factor to the death.

## Timelines
*   Date Claim Processed for ADB: January 25, 2023
*   Denial Letter Issued: January 27, 2023
*   Appeal Period Ends: March 28, 2023
