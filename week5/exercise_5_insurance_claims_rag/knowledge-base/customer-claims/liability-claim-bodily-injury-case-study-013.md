**Location:** Greenwood Park Apartments, Common Area Playground, 123 Elm Street, Anytown, USA
**Description:** Ms. Eleanor Vance was walking through the designated common area playground at Greenwood Park Apartments. She tripped and fell over an exposed sprinkler head that was positioned approximately two inches above the ground surface. The sprinkler head was reported to be obscured by overgrown shrubbery, reducing its visibility.

## Claimant Details

**Date of Birth:** April 12, 1978 (45 years old at time of incident)
**Contact:** Provided through legal counsel.
**Employer:** Self-employed (graphic designer).

*   Fracture of the right distal radius (wrist).
*   Multiple contusions and abrasions to the right arm and hand.
*   Soft tissue strain in the right shoulder.

## Medical Treatment

*   **Date of Initial Treatment:** February 1, 2023 (Emergency Room visit, Anytown General Hospital).
*   **Diagnosis:** Right distal radius fracture, requiring closed reduction and casting.
*   **Follow-up Care:** Orthopedic specialist consultations, physical therapy (6 sessions).

*   **Loss of Earnings Claimed:** \$3,000 (Two weeks unable to work / reduced capacity).

## Evidence/Documentation Submitted

*   Claimant's Incident Report (provided by attorney).
*   Photos of the incident location (exposed sprinkler head, overgrown shrubbery).
*   Medical records and billing statements from Anytown General Hospital and Dr. Sarah Chen (Orthopedic Specialist).
*   Physical Therapy records from "Flexibility First PT Clinic."
*   Attorney demand letter including pain and suffering damages.
*   Letter from claimant confirming 14 days of lost work at an estimated daily rate.
*   Greenwood Property Management's maintenance logs (review revealed no recent inspection of the playground area foliage).

## Claim Investigation Summary

The investigation confirmed the presence of the exposed sprinkler head and verified the overgrown shrubbery through photographs and site visit by adjuster, Mr. David Miller. Greenwood Property Management's standard operating procedures require monthly landscaping inspections. The last documented inspection for the playground area was December 15, 2022, exceeding the 30-day interval. This lapse in scheduled maintenance was identified as a potential factor in the sprinkler head's obscured visibility.

## Legal Representation

*   **Claimant's Attorney:** Laura Jenkins, Jenkins & Associates Law Firm.
*   **Insured's Attorney (appointed by insurer):** Michael Chen, Chen & Partners Legal.

## Decision Logic - Liability Assessment

**Criteria for Determining Liability:**

1.  **Presence of Hazardous Condition:** Was there a condition on the property that posed an unreasonable risk of harm?
    *   **Finding:** Yes, the exposed sprinkler head two inches above ground level, especially when obscured.
2.  **Property Owner's Knowledge (Actual or Constructive):** Did the property owner know or should have known about the hazard?
    *   **Finding:** Constructive knowledge. The lack of adherence to the monthly inspection schedule for overgrown foliage suggests Greenwood Property Management should have known about the obscured sprinkler head and the potential hazard.
3.  **Failure to Remedy/Warn:** Did the property owner fail to take reasonable steps to remedy the hazard or warn visitors?
    *   **Finding:** Yes, the hazard was not remedied, and no visible warnings were present.
4.  **Causation:** Was the property owner's negligence a direct cause of the claimant's injury?
    *   **Finding:** Yes, the claimant tripped directly over the hazardous condition.

**Liability Determination:** Based on the above criteria, a strong argument for premises liability against Greenwood Property Management LLC was established. The primary contributing factor was the failure to maintain the landscaping, leading to the obscuring of the hazard.

## Settlement Negotiations

*   **Claimant's Initial Demand:** \$25,000 (Medical: \$8,750, Lost Wages: \$3,000, Pain & Suffering: \$13,250).
*   **Insurer's Initial Offer:** \$12,000.
*   **Negotiation Points:**
    *   Insurer highlighted Ms. Vance's failure to watch her steps, suggesting possible comparative negligence (rejected by attorney).
    *   Attorney emphasized the clear breach of the insured's own maintenance protocols.
    *   Medical review indicated a full recovery with no anticipated long-term impairment, limiting pain and suffering valuation.
*   **Final Settlement:** \$18,500.
    *   Medical Expenses: \$8,750 (paid directly to providers/to claimant via subrogation release)
    *   Lost Wages: \$3,000
    *   Pain & Suffering: \$6,750

**Decision Point:** Agreement to the \$18,500 settlement was based on:
1.  High probability of adverse judgment for the insured if litigated due to clear evidence of negligence.
2.  Desire to avoid costly legal defense fees and potential higher jury award.
3.  Confirmation of medical expenses and lost wages as reasonable and directly attributable to the incident.
4.  Pain and suffering component aligning with similar claims for non-permanent, fully recovered fractures at this age.

## Resolution

The claim was settled on March 8, 2023, for \$18,500. A settlement agreement and release of all claims were signed by Ms. Eleanor Vance and her legal counsel on March 9, 2023. Payment was disbursed on March 10, 2023.

## Lessons Learned

*   **Importance of SOP Adherence:** This case highlights the critical need for property management to strictly follow their maintenance schedules and standard operating procedures (SOPs) to prevent foreseeable hazards. Lack of adherence directly contributed to liability.
*   **Prompt Investigation:** Early and thorough investigation, including site visits and photo evidence, was crucial in establishing the facts and assessing liability quickly, leading to efficient negotiation.
*   **Documentation Quality:** Detailed medical records and clear evidence of lost income strengthened the claimant's position and enabled accurate assessment of damages.
*   **Comparative Negligence:** While considered, the clear negligence of the property owner in maintaining premises significantly reduced the viability of a comparative negligence defense.
