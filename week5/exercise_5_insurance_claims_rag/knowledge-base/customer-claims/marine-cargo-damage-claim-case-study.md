## Main Content: Claim Narrative

### 1. Shipment Details
*   **Policy Number:** MC-GLO-2022-001
*   **Voyage From:** Shanghai, China
*   **Voyage To:** Rotterdam, Netherlands
*   **Vessel Name:** MV Ocean Pioneer
*   **Voyage Number:** OP-V23-017
*   **Bill of Lading Number:** SLBL-2023-789012
*   **Container Number:** TCNU-1234567
*   **Cargo Description:** 2 units of XYZ-Pro Industrial Press Machines (Crated)
*   **Policy Coverage:** "All Risks" Institute Cargo Clauses (A)

*   **Arrival Date (Port):** September 10, 2023
*   **Delivery Date (Consignee Warehouse):** September 14, 2023

### 2. Incident Description
On September 15, 2023, Global Engineering Solutions (Consignee) notified us via their broker of significant damage to one of the two XYZ-Pro Industrial Press Machines. Upon uncrating at their warehouse, they discovered severe denting and deformation to the main frame and crucial hydraulic components of Unit 1. Unit 2 was reported to be in good condition. The damage was not immediately visible on the exterior of the crate upon delivery to the warehouse.

### 3. Initial Actions and Evidence Provided by Insured
Upon notification, the insured provided the following immediate evidence:
*   Initial Claim Notification Form (dated Sep 15, 2023)
*   Copy of Bill of Lading (SLBL-2023-789012)
*   Copy of Commercial Invoice (€225,000 per unit)
*   Photos of damaged machinery inside the opened crate (stamped Sep 15, 2023), clearly showing impact marks and deformation.
*   Condition of Cargo on Arrival (COCA) report from the carrier's agent at discharge, noting "crates intact, no apparent external damage." This contradicted the internal findings.
*   Packing List (detailing internal crating methods).

## Requirements/Criteria for Claim Validity
For a marine cargo damage claim to be considered valid under Policy #MC-GLO-2022-001 with "All Risks" Institute Cargo Clauses (A) coverage, the following criteria must be met:
1.  **Notification:** Damage reported within 7 days of delivery to consignee's warehouse or completion of discharge. (Met - reported on Sep 15, delivered Sep 14).
2.  **Coverage Type:** Damage must be directly caused by an insured peril, not an exclusion (e.g., inherent vice, ordinary leakage, pre-shipment damage). "All Risks" provides broad coverage, shifting burden of proof to insurer for exclusions.
3.  **Documentation:** Complete set of shipping documents (B/L, invoice, packing list) and initial damage evidence (photos, surveyor report) provided.
4.  **Proof of Loss:** Substantiated by an independent survey report quantifying the extent and cause of damage.
5.  **Subrogation Rights:** Insured must assign subrogation rights to the insurer.

## Procedures/Steps Followed

### Step 1: Claim Registration (September 15, 2023)
*   Claim Ref. MC-2023-09-014 registered in the system.
*   Initial documents reviewed for completeness and immediate flags.

### Step 2: Surveyor Appointment (September 16, 2023)
*   IMS, a recognized independent marine surveyor, was immediately appointed to inspect the damaged machine at the consignee's premises in Rotterdam.
*   Instructions included: assess the extent of damage, determine the likely cause, estimate repair costs or depreciation, and identify potential subrogation targets.

### Step 3: Surveyor's Investigation and Report (September 18 - September 22, 2023)
*   IMS conducted an on-site inspection.
*   Interviewed consignee's receiving personnel.
*   Examined the damaged machine, the crating, and packaging materials.
*   Reviewed the carrier's COCA and other shipping documents.
*   **Key Findings (IMS Report Ref. IMS-NL-23-0112, dated Sep 22, 2023):**
    *   **Damage Extent:** Main frame bent 5-7mm out of alignment, hydraulic pump housing cracked, control panel impact deformation. Machine deemed non-functional without substantial repair.
    *   **Packaging:** Internal foam blocks compressed and fractured at the point of impact on the machine. Exterior crate panels showed no breach or impact marks. However, the internal dunnage securing the machine to the crate base was found to be partially displaced/damaged specifically around the damaged area, indicating a strong internal shift or external impact that was absorbed by the crate.
    *   **Probable Cause:** "Heavy impact during transit, likely due to external force or sudden severe shifting within the container. The damage pattern suggests direct pressure on the side of the unit, transferring through compromised internal bracing."
    *   **Repair vs. Replacement:** Repair costs estimated at €180,000 due to specialized parts and labor, with a potential 10% residual value loss even after repair. Replacement cost for a new unit is €225,000.
    *   **Salvage:** Consignee is holding the damaged unit for potential salvage or detailed inspection by the carrier.

### Step 4: Review and Adjudication (September 25 - October 1, 2023)
*   The Claims Department reviewed the IMS report against policy terms.
*   The "All Risks" clause covered sudden accidental external damage. The surveyor's findings supported an external force or severe internal shift, consistent with an insured peril during transit.
*   The discrepancy between the carrier's COCA (intact crate) and the internal damage was noted. The surveyor's finding of damaged internal dunnage, despite an intact exterior, suggested a significant force that the external packaging absorbed without showing outward signs. This is critical for internal impact assessment.
*   **Decision Logic:** Given the extent of damage (€180k repair vs. €225k replacement), the cost-effectiveness decision was to declare the unit a constructive total loss or arrange for replacement. The policy usually dictates that if repair costs exceed 75-80% of insured value, replacement is preferred. In this case, 180,000 / 225,000 = 80%, indicating a constructive total loss.

## Decision and Settlement

*   **Decision Date:** October 2, 2023
*   Based on the IMS report and policy terms, the claim for Unit 1 was approved for its full insured value.
*   **Resolution:** Indemnity payment for €225,000.
*   **Subrogation:** Global Engineering Solutions assigned subrogation rights to us against SeaLink Lines and/or their agents. We will pursue recovery from the carrier based on the surveyor's findings regarding possible mishandling.

## Evidence/Documentation
The following documents were critical for the claim assessment:
*   Initial Claim Notification Form
*   Marine Cargo Policy #MC-GLO-2022-001
*   Bill of Lading SLBL-2023-789012
*   Commercial Invoice from ABC Manufacturing
*   Packing List
*   Detailed photos of damaged cargo at consignee's warehouse
*   Carrier's Condition of Cargo on Arrival (COCA) report
*   International Marine Surveyors (IMS) Report Ref. IMS-NL-23-0112
*   Correspondence with the insured and broker
*   Proof of Indemnity Payment (Bank Transfer Confirmation Ref. PAY-MC-2023-014, dated Oct 25, 2023)

## Timelines
*   **Damage Notification:** September 15, 2023 (1 day post-delivery)
*   **Surveyor Appointed:** September 16, 2023
*   **Survey Report Issued:** September 22, 2023
*   **Claim Adjudication Completed:** October 2, 2023
*   **Indemnity Payment Issued:** October 25, 2023 (within 30 days of approval)

## Exceptions
No significant exceptions were made in this case. The claim adhered to standard procedures and policy terms. The only minor point of discussion was the discrepancy in the carrier's COCA, which was subsequently overridden by the detailed findings of the independent marine surveyor regarding internal damage despite an intact exterior. This highlights the importance of timely independent survey.
