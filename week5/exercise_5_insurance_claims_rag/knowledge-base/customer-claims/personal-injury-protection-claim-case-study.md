# Personal Injury Protection Claim Case Study: Jane Doe

## Overview/Purpose
This document details a Personal Injury Protection (PIP) claim filed by Jane Doe following a motor vehicle accident. It serves as a case study to demonstrate the processing, evaluation, and resolution of PIP claims, focusing on medical bill adjudication, lost wage calculations, and overall claim management. This case study highlights typical challenges and the decision logic applied by claim adjusters.

## Scope
This case study covers the period from the accident date (December 1, 2022) through the final settlement/payment of all covered PIP benefits (May 31, 2023). It includes medical treatment, related expenses, lost wages, and administrative processing. It does not cover property damage claims or liability claims against third parties.

## Definitions
*   **PIP (Personal Injury Protection):** A component of auto insurance that covers medical expenses and lost wages for the insured and other occupants of the vehicle, regardless of fault.
*   **Medical Lien:** A legal claim placed on personal injury settlements to ensure healthcare providers are paid for services rendered.
*   **UCR (Usual, Customary, and Reasonable):** The process used to determine the appropriate amount to pay for a medical service, based on charges for the same or similar services in the same geographic area and by practitioners of similar specialty.
*   **IME (Independent Medical Examination):** An evaluation by a physician chosen by the insurance company to confirm the extent of injuries and the necessity of ongoing treatment.
*   **WC (Workers' Compensation):** A form of insurance providing wage replacement and medical benefits to employees injured in the course of employment. PIP benefits are typically secondary to WC.

*   **Subsequent Reduced Schedule:** 2 hours reduction per day for 4 weeks (December 11, 2022 - January 5, 2023) due to physical therapy appointments and persistent discomfort.
*   **Total Hours Lost:** (5 days * 8 hours/day) + (4 weeks * 5 days/week * 2 hours/day) = 40 hours + 40 hours = 80 hours.

*   **Timely Notification:** Claim was reported within 24 hours of the accident.

## Decision Logic and Adjudication Process

### Medical Bill Processing
*   **ER and Ambulance Bills:** Processed at 100% of the billed amount, as services were emergent and directly related to the accident.
    *   Anytown General Hospital ER: Paid $2,500.00
    *   Ambulance Service: Paid $850.00
*   **Primary Care Visit:** Processed at 100% of the billed amount.
    *   Dr. Smith: Paid $150.00
*   **Physical Therapy Bills:**
    *   Initial 6 weeks (18 sessions): Approved and paid at 100% of UCR, which matched the billed rate of $150/session. Total $2,700.00.
    *   Subsequent 4 weeks (Dr. Jones' recommendation): **Adjuster Review Required.** Based on the MRI findings showing pre-existing degenerative changes and absence of acute injury, an IME was requested by the insurer.
        *   **IME Decision Trigger:** Lack of significant objective improvement after initial PT course, and MRI findings not directly supporting prolonged, intense therapy for acute injury.
        *   **IME Verdict (Dr. Evans, Orthopedic Specialist):** After reviewing records and examining Jane Doe on February 15, 2023, Dr. Evans concluded that 2 additional weeks of PT were reasonable, but further PT beyond that would likely not yield significant functional improvement directly attributable to the December 1st accident. He recommended a home exercise program.
        *   **Adjudication:** The insurer approved and paid for 6 additional PT sessions ($900.00) based on the IME recommendation, bringing the total paid PT to 24 sessions. The remaining 6 sessions claimed were denied.
*   **Orthopedic Specialist Visit (Dr. Jones):** Processed at 100% of the billed amount.
    *   Dr. Jones: Paid $300.00
*   **MRI Scan Bill:** Processed at 100% of UCR. The billed amount of $1,200.00 was within the UCR guidelines for the geographic area.
    *   Diagnostic Imaging Center: Paid $1,200.00

### Lost Wages Processing
*   **Documentation Required:**
    *   Employer's Statement of Lost Wages (signed and dated by ABC Corp HR).
    *   Pay stubs for 3 months prior to the accident.
    *   Doctor's note (Attending Physician's Statement - APS) explicitly stating the period Jane Doe was unable to work or required reduced hours due to accident-related injuries.
*   **Evidence Provided:** All required documentation was submitted. Dr. Smith’s initial APS noted an inability to work for 5 days and recommended reduced activity/hours for 4 weeks for PT.
*   **Calculation:**
    *   Initial 40 hours: Approved, as supported by APS.
    *   Reduced schedule 40 hours: Approved, as supported by APS.
*   **Adjudication:** Total lost wages of $2,000.00 were approved and paid. This amount was within the policy's lost wage limit of $2,500.

## Exceptions
*   No significant exceptions were noted in this case. The IME decision regarding the extent of physical therapy was a standard process for disputes over medical necessity.
*   There was no indication of Workers' Compensation applicability, as the accident occurred outside of work hours and duties.
