# Home Hail Damage Roof - Case Study 006

## 1. Overview

This document details the handling of a residential home insurance claim (Claim ID: HOME-2023-01-15-006) for roof damage sustained due to a hailstorm. The case study outlines the initial report, inspection findings, decision-making process for repair versus full replacement, and the final resolution. This case serves as an example for evaluating similar hail damage claims.

## 2. Scope

This case study covers the period from claim initiation on January 15, 2023, through to claim closure on March 10, 2023. It specifically focuses on the evaluation of roof damage on a single-family residential property located at 123 Maple Drive, Anytown, USA 12345. It includes damage assessment, repair estimates, and policy application. This case study does not include any interior damage or damage to other structures on the property.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Actual Cash Value (ACV):** The cost to replace damaged property with new property of like kind and quality, less depreciation.
*   **Replacement Cost Value (RCV):** The cost to replace damaged property with new property of like kind and quality, without deduction for depreciation.
*   **Dimpling:** Small depressions or indentations caused by hail impact, often visible on soft metals or granular surfaces.
*   **Granule Loss:** The detachment and loss of protective mineral granules from asphalt shingles, exposing the underlying mat to UV degradation.
*   **Bruising:** Softening or fracture of the shingle's asphalt mat beneath the granular surface, typically caused by hail impact, compromising the shingle's integrity.
*   **Splitting:** Cracks or tears in shingles, sometimes exacerbated by underlying hail damage.
*   **Peril:** The cause of loss (e.g., hail, wind, fire).

## 4. Claim Narrative

**Claim ID:** HOME-2023-01-15-006
**Policyholder:** John & Jane Doe
**Location:** 123 Maple Drive, Anytown, USA 12345
**Date of Loss:** January 12, 2023
**Date Reported:** January 15, 2023
**Type of Loss:** Hailstorm, affecting roof system.

The insured, John Doe, reported significant hail damage to the roof of his primary residence following a severe hailstorm that occurred on January 12, 2023. The insured observed widespread granule loss and depressions on most roof slopes. The policy in force is a Homeowners Policy (HO-3) with RCV coverage for dwelling and other structures, and a 1% hurricane/wind/hail deductible, amounting to $2,500 based on the dwelling coverage of $250,000.

## 5. Inspection and Damage Assessment

### 5.1. Initial Contact and Scheduling

An initial contact was made with the policyholder on January 15, 2023, and an inspection was scheduled for January 19, 2023, with Field Adjuster Sarah Jenkins.

### 5.2. Inspection Findings - January 19, 2023

Field Adjuster Sarah Jenkins conducted a thorough physical inspection of the roof and exterior of the property.

*   **Roof Type:** Architectural Laminate Asphalt Shingles, approximately 12 years old.
*   **Roof Slopes:**
    *   Front (North-facing): Moderate granule loss, 8 confirmed hail impacts (bruising) per 100 sq ft.
    *   Rear (South-facing): Severe granule loss, 15 confirmed hail impacts (bruising) per 100 sq ft. Visible bruising and some minor splitting.
    *   West-facing: Moderate granule loss, 7 confirmed hail impacts per 100 sq ft.
    *   East-facing: Light granule loss, 5 confirmed hail impacts per 100 sq ft.
*   **Gutters:** Minor dimpling on several sections of aluminum gutters, primarily on the south and west sides. No functional damage.
*   **Downspouts:** No damage.
*   **Window Screens:** Minor tears on two screens, consistent with hail impact.
*   **Siding:** No observable damage to vinyl siding.
*   **Fencing:** Minor impacts to wooden fence posts, cosmetic only.

**Conclusion of Inspection:** Hail damage was confirmed to be widespread across multiple roof slopes, exceeding the cosmetic damage threshold. The nature of the damage (bruising, significant granule loss on most slopes) indicated that the roof's protective layer and integrity had been compromised by the hailstorm event of January 12, 2023.

## 6. Decision Logic: Repair vs. Replacement

The primary decision point was whether to repair specific sections of the roof or to recommend a full roof replacement.

### 6.1. Criteria for Full Roof Replacement

A full roof replacement is justified when *any* of the following conditions are met:

1.  **Widespread Damage:** Damage (bruising, granule loss, fracturing) is found uniformly or extensively across 50% or more of the roof slopes, making spot repairs impractical or aesthetically incongruent.
2.  **Matching Issues:** Existing shingle product is no longer manufactured or readily available, making a patch repair visually mismatched and detracting from the property's aesthetic value (Matching of Undamaged Property Endorsement applies).
3.  **Functional Impairment:** Damage compromises the roof's waterproofing integrity or significantly reduces its expected lifespan.
4.  **Cost-Effectiveness:** The cost of extensive repairs, including potential future color matching issues, approaches or exceeds the cost of a full replacement (typically 75% or more of total RCV replacement cost).
5.  **Per-Square-Foot Impact Count:** More than 6 confirmed hail impacts resulting in bruising or fracturing within any 10 ft x 10 ft (100 sq ft) test square on a majority (50%+) of roof slopes.

### 6.2. Criteria for Repair

Partial roof repair is typically considered when:

1.  Damage is isolated to one or two contiguous roof slopes.
2.  Matching shingles are readily available and can be seamlessly integrated.
3.  The estimated repair cost is significantly less than a full replacement (e.g., less than 50% of the RCV replacement cost).
4.  Damage is purely cosmetic with no functional impact or reduction in roof lifespan.

### 6.3. Decision for Claim HOME-2023-01-15-006

Based on the inspection findings for 123 Maple Drive:

*   **Widespread Damage:** Damage (bruising and significant granule loss) was confirmed on 3 out of 4 roof slopes (Front, Rear, West), which is 75% of the roof area.
*   **Per-Square-Foot Impact Count:** The Rear (South-facing) slope showed 15 impacts/100 sq ft, and the Front (North-facing) slope showed 8 impacts/100 sq ft. Both exceed the 6 impacts/100 sq ft threshold.
*   **Age of Roof:** While not the sole deciding factor, the 12-year-old roof, combined with widespread significant damage, supported the replacement decision as repair would likely only provide a short-term solution given the integrity compromise.

**Decision:** Full roof replacement is recommended due to widespread functional hail damage as per criteria #1 and #5.

## 7. Estimate and Settlement

### 7.1. Scope of Work

The scope of work for the roofing contractor includes:
