## Main Content

### 1. Initial Claim Assessment (January 15 - January 20, 2023)
*   **FNOL:** Received on January 15, 2023, at 09:30 AM PST.
*   **Initial Contact:** Adjuster met with insured and confirmed property was uninhabitable. Immediate ALE arrangements were made for temporary housing at a local hotel.
*   **Emergency Services:** Emergency board-up and temporary fencing were authorized ($3,500).
*   **Structural Inspection:** On January 17, 2023, a structural engineer deemed the dwelling a total loss due to fire and smoke damage, with significant collapse of roof and second-story flooring. Foundation also showed signs of stress.

### 2. Investigation and Valuation (January 21 - March 10, 2023)

#### 2.1 Dwelling Damage Assessment
*   **Contractor Estimates:** Three independent bids were obtained for reconstruction. All estimates exceeded the Coverage A limit of $400,000, confirming total loss status.
*   **Actual Cash Value Determination:** A depreciation analysis was conducted by a third-party appraiser. Given the age of the home (built 1975) and pre-loss condition, the ACV for the dwelling was assessed at $360,000.
*   **Replacement Cost Calculation:** Due to total loss and the cost to rebuild exceeding the Coverage A limit, the full Coverage A limit of $400,000 was approved for the dwelling.

#### 2.2 Personal Property Loss Assessment
*   **Contents Inventory:** Insured submitted a detailed inventory list with purchase dates and estimated replacement costs.
*   **Documentation:** Receipts were provided for high-value items (electronics, jewelry, major appliances). For undocumented items, average consumer replacement costs were used, adjusted for depreciation.
*   **Depreciation Application:** An item-by-item depreciation schedule was applied to calculate ACV. For example:
    *   Sofa (5 years old, $1,500 RCV) - 40% depreciation = $900 ACV
    *   TV (2 years old, $800 RCV) - 20% depreciation = $640 ACV
*   **ACV Payment:** A preliminary payment of $120,000 (ACV) was issued for contents.
*   **RCV Holdback:** The remaining $80,000 (RCV less ACV) was held back, contingent upon presentation of receipts for replacement within 180 days of ACV payment.

#### 2.3 Additional Living Expenses (ALE)
*   **Initial Period:** Hotel costs for 30 days ($6,000) were covered.
*   **Rental Home:** Insured secured a 6-month lease on a comparable rental home for $3,000 per month. Rent, utilities, and temporary furniture rental were approved up to the ALE limit.
*   **Tracking:** Insured submitted monthly expense logs. As of May 22, 2023, $15,000 in ALE had been disbursed. The remaining balance within the $80,000 limit was available for the rebuild period.

### 3. Settlement Negotiation and Final Agreement (March 11 - May 22, 2023)

#### 3.1 Dwelling Settlement
*   The full Coverage A limit of $400,000 was agreed upon for the dwelling, considering the total loss status and reconstruction estimates.
*   A payment of $399,000 was issued (Coverage A - Deductible).

#### 3.2 Personal Property Settlement
*   The ACV payment of $120,000 was finalized.
*   The RCV holdback of $80,000 remained active, with specific instruction for submitting receipts. Insured was advised to retain all receipts for new purchases.

#### 3.3 ALE Settlement
*   ALE will continue to be paid as incurred, up to the remaining limit of $65,000 ($80,000 allocated - $15,000 already disbursed), for the period required to rebuild and re-occupy the primary dwelling. The maximum period for ALE is 12 months from the date of loss or until the dwelling is habitable, whichever comes first, within the policy limit.

## Requirements/Criteria
*   **Total Loss Declaration:** Requires explicit sign-off from a licensed structural engineer or two independent contractors whose estimates exceed the Coverage A limit.
*   **Contents RCV Reimbursement:** Requires submission of valid receipts for replacement items, purchased within 180 days of the ACV payment, clearly showing like-kind and quality replacement.
*   **ALE Reimbursement:** Requires submission of detailed expense logs and receipts for all additional living costs that exceed normal living expenses. Normal utilities, mortgage payments, and other non-additional expenses are excluded.
*   **Property Deed:** Verification of ownership required prior to dwelling payment.

## Decision Logic
*   **Total Loss Determination:** If reconstruction cost estimates exceed 80% of Coverage A OR structural engineer report deems property unsafe/beyond repair, then declare total loss and pay full Coverage A (less deductible).
*   **RCV vs. ACV for Contents:** Initial payment is always ACV. RCV payment is conditional upon proof of replacement within policy-defined timeframe (180 days). If no proof, claim closes at ACV for contents.
*   **ALE Continuance:** If the primary dwelling remains uninhabitable and expenses are justified, ALE payments continue up to Coverage D limit. If suitable housing is refused or reconstruction ceases, ALE payments may be suspended.
