## Claim Narrative

### Incident Report
On September 15, 2023, at approximately 08:30 AM EST, Ms. Jane Doe reported a burst pipe incident in her residence at 123 Oak Avenue, Anytown, USA. She discovered significant water accumulation in the basement and on the main floor after returning from a weekend trip. The burst occurred in a ¾-inch copper supply line leading to the washing machine in the laundry room on the first floor. Water flowed for an estimated 48-72 hours before discovery.

### Emergency Response and Mitigation
*   **09/15/2023, 09:15 AM:** Emergency plumber (Anytown Plumbing) dispatched. Water main shut off.
*   **09/15/2023, 11:30 AM:** Initial water extraction initiated by RapidDry Restoration Services. Approximately 300 gallons of freestanding water were removed from the basement and first-floor areas.
*   **09/15/2023, 04:00 PM:** RapidDry Restoration Services began placement of drying equipment: 10 commercial air movers, 3 large dehumidifiers (LGR 2000), and 2 heat distribution units in affected areas (basement, laundry room, kitchen, living room).

## Damage Assessment

### Affected Areas
*   **Basement:** Finished basement with drywall, carpet over concrete slab. Water intrusion covered approximately 600 sq ft.
*   **First Floor:** Laundry room (vinyl flooring), kitchen (hardwood flooring), partial living room (hardwood flooring). Water affected approximately 350 sq ft.

### Detailed Damage Analysis
*   **Drywall:** 4 ft flood cut required in basement across 60 linear feet. Sections of drywall in laundry and kitchen require removal due to saturation.
*   **Flooring:**
    *   Basement: Carpet and pad completely saturated, requiring removal and disposal (600 sq ft).
    *   First Floor (Kitchen/Living Room): Hardwood flooring showed significant cupping and buckling over 350 sq ft. Visual inspection and moisture meter readings (average 18-22% MC) indicated non-restorable condition, requiring removal.
    *   First Floor (Laundry): Vinyl flooring over subfloor, subfloor showed moisture intrusion, requiring removal (50 sq ft).
*   **Insulation:** Soffit and wall cavity insulation in basement affected, requiring removal and replacement (R-13 batt, 60 linear ft).
*   **Cabinetry:** Base cabinets in kitchen showed signs of water wicking, requiring removal of base toe kicks and internal drying. Minimal delamination observed, deemed restorable.
*   **Contents:** Extensive damage to personal contents in basement, including soaked books, electronics, and furniture. A detailed contents inventory was initiated.

## Drying Process and Monitoring
*   **09/16/2023 - 09/22/2023:** Monitoring occurred daily. Moisture content readings were taken from structural components (framing, subfloor, drywall) using a Tramex BMR moisture meter. Humidity and temperature readings were recorded.
*   **Target Readings:** Goal for wood framing and subfloor was below 12% MC. Drywall target was below 15% MC and within 3% of unaffected areas.
*   **Results:** By September 22, 2023, all affected structural materials met drying standards. Equipment was removed.
