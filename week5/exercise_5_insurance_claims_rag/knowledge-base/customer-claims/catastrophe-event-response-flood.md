# Catastrophe Event Response Case Study: Flood Claim Handling (Hurricane Delta, October 2020)

## Overview/Purpose
This document presents a case study detailing our company's response and claim processing procedures following Hurricane Delta, which caused widespread flooding in coastal Louisiana in October 2020. The purpose is to analyze the effectiveness of our catastrophe (CAT) response plan, identify best practices, and highlight areas for future improvement in handling large-scale flood claims. This case study serves as a reference for agents and claims adjusters managing similar events.

## Scope
This case study focuses on flood claims received and processed within the Louisiana parishes of Calcasieu, Cameron, Vermilion, and Jefferson Davis, which were declared federal disaster areas for individual assistance due to Hurricane Delta. It covers the period from October 10, 2020, through February 28, 2021. Excluded from this analysis are claims related to wind-only damage or claims outside the specified geographical and temporal scope.

## Definitions
*   **CAT Event:** Catastrophe event, typically defined by a large number of claims arising from a single natural disaster (e.g., hurricane, earthquake, widespread flood).
*   **NFIP:** National Flood Insurance Program, a federal program providing flood insurance. Our company services NFIP policies on behalf of FEMA.
*   **Writ of Assistance:** A formal court order obtained by NFIP adjusters to gain entry to properties when a policyholder is unreachable or refuses access, often used for urgent damage assessment.
*   **Advance Payment:** A partial payment issued to policyholders to assist with immediate living expenses and initial repair costs, typically before final claim settlement.
*   **Proof of Loss (POL):** A sworn statement of the amount of loss claimed, submitted by the insured to the insurer, usually required within 60 days of the loss or date of request.
*   **Adjuster Deployment Strategy:** The plan for assigning and mobilizing claims adjusters to disaster-affected areas.

## Main Content: Event Timeline and Response

### October 2020: Initial Impact and Emergency Response
*   **October 9:** Hurricane Delta makes landfall as a Category 2 hurricane near Creole, Louisiana, causing significant storm surge and inland flooding, particularly in areas still recovering from Hurricane Laura (August 2020).
*   **October 10-12:** Initial surge of claims reported. Our CAT team activated immediately.
    *   **Decision:** Prioritize policyholders showing immediate signs of displacement or major structural damage (e.g., roof collapse, visible water lines above 2 feet).
    *   **Action:** Established a dedicated CAT call center line. Deployed 50 flood-certified adjusters to Baton Rouge staging area.

### October 2020 - November 2020: Claim Intake and Initial Assessment
*   **Claims Volume:** Approximately 2,500 flood claims received in the first 72 hours, totaling 7,800 claims within the first month across affected parishes.
*   **Expedited Contact:** Our target for initial policyholder contact was 24 hours for severe damage claims and 48 hours for others. Achieved 90% contact rate within these targets.
*   **Advance Payments:**
    *   **Criteria:** Policyholder confirmed displaced from primary residence, significant visible water damage to contents or structure, and a clear need for immediate financial assistance. No advance payments for secondary homes or investment properties unless specific hardship is demonstrated and approved by a Senior CAT Adjuster.
    *   **Process:** Policyholders could request an advance payment during initial contact. Adjuster verified initial damage assessment (photos/video) and completed an Advance Payment Request Form (Form NFIP-APR-001).
    *   **Payment Thresholds:** Up to $5,000 for contents, up to $2,000 for additional living expenses (ALE). Maximum total advance payment: $7,000.
    *   **Outcome:** 1,200 advance payments issued within the first week, averaging $4,500 per payment. This significantly reduced initial financial strain for policyholders.

### November 2020 - December 2020: Field Adjustments and Damage Evaluation
*   **Adjuster Deployment:** Full deployment of 150 NFIP-certified adjusters by November 1st, covering all affected zones.
*   **Inspection Protocol:**
    *   **High Water Marks:** Document definitive highest water line inside and outside the structure.
    *   **Foundation Damage:** Thorough assessment for cracking, shifting, or settlement due to saturated soils.
    *   **Electrical/HVAC:** Mandatory licensed electrician/HVAC technician inspection for systems submerged by floodwaters. Reimbursement for inspection up to $250.
    *   **Contents Inventory:** Policyholders guided on creating detailed lists with photos. Provided NFIP Contents Worksheet (Form NFIP-CW-001).
*   **Challenges:**
    *   **Access:** Road closures and ongoing water presence in some remote areas hindered immediate access. Used amphibious vehicles for some assessments.
    *   **Fraud Prevention:** Implemented stricter scrutiny for policies written immediately before the storm or showing unusual loss patterns. Conducted random spot checks by senior adjusters.
    *   **Documentation:** Emphasized clear, date-stamped photos and detailed reports to support all damage assessments.

### January 2021 - February 2021: Claim Closures and Proof of Loss
*   **Proof of Loss (POL) Submission:**
    *   **Requirement:** Policyholders were informed that a signed and notarized POL was required within 60 days of the adjuster's report being finalized or a company request letter.
    *   **Assistance:** Adjusters provided guidance on completing POL forms. Our customer service team offered virtual POL completion sessions.
*   **Settlement Process:**
    *   **Minor Damage (<$10,000):** Processed and paid within 5 business days of approved POL.
    *   **Moderate Damage ($10,001 - $50,000):** Reviewed by a Senior Claims Examiner, paid within 10 business days of approved POL.
    *   **Major Damage (>$50,000 or Complex):** Assigned to a dedicated Claims Manager, may require additional inspections or expert reports (e.g., engineering reports). Target payment within 20 business days of approved POL.
*   **Total Claims Paid:** 7,100 claims successfully closed by February 28, 2021, representing 91% of total claims received.
*   **Average Settlement Time:** 65 days from date of loss to final payment for closed claims.

## Requirements/Criteria
*   **NFIP Policy in force:** All claims required a valid NFIP flood insurance policy active at the time of loss.
*   **Proof of Damage:** Clear evidence of direct physical loss or damage by flood (e.g., water lines, saturated materials, documented debris).
*   **Timely notification:** Policyholders were required to notify the insurer as soon as reasonably possible, ideally within 60 days of the flood event.
*   **Cooperation:** Policyholders must provide access to property, reasonable documentation, and sworn statements as required.

## Procedures/Steps
1.  **Claim Report:** Policyholder initiates claim via phone, online portal, or agent.
2.  **Initial Contact & Damage Assessment:** CAT team contacts policyholder, assesses immediate needs, and dispatches adjuster.
3.  **Adjuster Inspection:** Field adjuster visits site, documents damage, takes photos, identifies high water mark, secures required forms (e.g., AOB if applicable).
4.  **Estimate Generation:** Adjuster prepares detailed estimate using Xactimate based on NFIP guidelines.
5.  **Review & Approval:** Estimate reviewed by desk adjuster/claims examiner for compliance and accuracy.
6.  **Proof of Loss Submission:** Policyholder completes and submits POL with supporting documents (e.g., inventory lists, contractor estimates).
7.  **Payment Initiation:** Once POL approved, payment is issued consistent with policy terms and NFIP guidelines.

## Exceptions
*   **Unreachable Policyholders:** For properties in severely affected or isolated areas where policyholders could not be contacted after multiple attempts (minimum 3 phone calls, 2 emails, 1 certified letter over 7 days), a Writ of Assistance was sought from FEMA to allow adjuster access for initial damage assessment. This ensured timely evaluation and preservation of evidence.
*   **Disputed Amount:** If the policyholder disputes the settlement amount, the claim is rerouted to a dedicated Senior Dispute Resolution Specialist within 3 business days for re-evaluation and negotiation. Mediation options are offered if an agreement cannot be reached.
*   **Concurrent Loss (Wind & Flood):** For properties also affected by wind damage (covered under separate homeowner's policy), strict separation of damages was required based on cause of loss. Joint inspections with the HO carrier's adjuster were coordinated to streamline the process where possible, with priority given to flood damage assessment.

## Examples
*   **Example 1 (Advance Payment Success):** John S., policy number FLD-LA-0012345, Calcasieu Parish. Reported 3 feet of water in his primary residence. Displaced to a hotel. Requested advance payment. Adjuster confirmed significant damage via photos. $2,000 ALE and $3,000 contents advance issued within 48 hours for a total of $5,000, allowing John to secure temporary housing and essential items.
*   **Example 2 (Complex Claim Resolution):** Sarah K., policy number FLD-LA-0056789, Cameron Parish. Home completely destroyed and swept off foundation. Required engineering report to confirm structural integrity loss and specific cause. Claims Manager expedited the engineering review process. Final settlement of $250,000 (maximum NFIP building coverage) received 80 days post-loss following POL submission.
*   **Example 3 (Fraud Identification):** A claim was filed by *[Redacted Name]*, policy number FLD-LA-0098765, for a property that public records and satellite imagery indicated had been vacant and derelict for over 5 years. Adjuster found no personal property and minimal structural damage beyond pre-existing conditions. Claim was denied after thorough investigation and referral for potential fraud.

## Decision Logic
*   **Claim Priority Logic:**
    *   **Level 1 (Highest):** Policyholders reporting total loss, structural collapse, or immediate life-safety threats. **Action:** Adjuster assigned within 4 hours, on-site within 24 hours.
    *   **Level 2 (High):** Significant water intrusion (over 1 ft), displacement confirmed, or elderly/vulnerable policyholders. **Action:** Adjuster assigned within 8 hours, on-site within 48 hours.
    *   **Level 3 (Moderate):** Minor to moderate damage, policyholder has safe temporary residence. **Action:** Adjuster assigned within 24 hours, on-site within 72 hours.
    *   **Level 4 (Low):** Reports of minimal cosmetic damage, no displacement. **Action:** Adjuster assigned within 48 hours, inspection within 5 business days.
*   **Escalation Criteria:** Any claim exceeding $100,000 estimated damage, requiring an architectural/engineering report, or involving legal inquiry is immediately escalated to a Senior Claims Manager for oversight.

## Evidence/Documentation
*   **Required Documentation:**
    *   Initial Notice of Loss (NOL)
    *   Adjuster's Preliminary Report and Detailed Estimate (Xactimate)
    *   Photographic evidence (date and time stamped) of high water marks, damage to structure and contents.
    *   Proof of Loss (NFIP Form NFIP-POL-001)

    *   Contents inventory sheets with values and replacement cost.
    *   Any third-party reports (e.g., engineering, mold assessment).
*   All documentation is stored electronically in the centralized claims management system, accessible by claim number.

## Timelines
*   **Initial Contact:** Target 24-48 hours from claim submission.
*   **Adjuster On-site Inspection:** Target 2-5 days for Level 1-3 claims, up to 7 days for Level 4.
*   **Estimate Delivery to Policyholder:** 5 business days post-inspection for straightforward claims.
*   **Proof of Loss Submission:** 60 days from date of loss or request from insurer. Extensions may be granted by FEMA.
