## Main Content: Claim Narrative and Resolution

### Incident Details

On August 15, 2023, at approximately 3:45 PM PDT, a three-vehicle collision occurred on Highway 101 Northbound near Exit 34B in San Bruno, CA.

*   **Vehicle A (Insured, David Miller):** 2018 Honda Civic. Was driving in the left lane.
*   **Vehicle B (Sarah Jenkins):** 2019 Toyota Camry. Was driving in the middle lane.
*   **Vehicle C (Robert Davis, Driver; Emily White, Passenger):** 2016 Ford F-150. Was driving in the right lane.

According to the police report (San Bruno PD Incident Rpt. #SBN-23-45678), Party A (Mr. Miller) made an unsafe lane change from the left lane into the middle lane, striking the front-left fender of Party B's vehicle (Ms. Jenkins). The impact caused Party B's vehicle to swerve violently into the right lane, where it rear-ended Party C's vehicle (Mr. Davis).

### Initial Claim Filings

*   **August 16, 2023:** Mr. David Miller (Insured) filed a claim (Claim ID: AUTOCC-2023-815-001) for damage to his 2018 Honda Civic and reported minor neck pain.
*   **August 16, 2023:** Ms. Sarah Jenkins (Party B) filed a claim with Apex Auto Insurance for extensive damage to her 2019 Toyota Camry and reported whiplash and arm contusions. She also indicated potential long-term medical treatment.
*   **August 16, 2023:** Mr. Robert Davis (Party C) filed a claim with Global Insurance Group for damage to his 2016 Ford F-150 and reported back pain.
*   **August 17, 2023:** Ms. Emily White (Party D), passenger in Party C's vehicle, filed a bodily injury claim through Party C's policy and subsequently directly with our company, reporting a fractured wrist and concussion requiring immediate emergency care and follow-up surgery.

### Liability Assessment and Decision Logic

Based on the police report, witness statements, and initial investigation, Mr. David Miller (Insured, Party A) was determined to be 100% at fault for initiating the chain reaction collision due to an unsafe lane change.

**Evidence Reviewed:**
*   San Bruno Police Department Accident Report #SBN-23-45678, citing California Vehicle Code 21658(a) - Unsafe Lane Change, issued to David Miller.
*   Witness statement from Mr. John Smith (witness ID: WS-1234), who was driving two cars behind Party A and observed the unsafe lane change.
*   Dashcam footage provided by Party C, confirming Party B swerving into their lane immediately following impact with Party A.
*   Photos from the scene showing impact points: front-left of Vehicle B, right-front of Vehicle A, and rear of Vehicle C.

**Decision Logic:** Our Claims Adjuster, Maria Rodriguez (Adjuster ID: MROD-123), established clear primary liability against our insured, Mr. Miller. This decision was based on the primary cause of the accident being his illegal and unsafe lane change, leading directly to the subsequent collisions.

### Subrogation Efforts

## Requirements/Criteria

## Procedures/Steps

2.  **Initial Contact:** Contact all involved parties to gather basic information and explain process.
3.  **Evidence Collection:**
    *   Obtain police report (SBN-23-45678).
    *   Gather witness statements (Mr. John Smith).
    *   Request photos/videos (Party C dashcam).
    *   Dispatch field adjuster for scene investigation (if necessary).

    *   Obtain estimates for Vehicle A, B, C.
    *   Evaluate total loss for Vehicle B.
    *   Arrange payments for repairs/total loss and rental cars.

    *   Issue payments.

8.  **Subrogation Review:** Determine if subrogation is applicable (not applicable in this case).
9.  **Claim Closure:** All payments made, parties satisfied, claim closed.

## Exceptions

*   This case did not involve uninsured/underinsured motorist (UM/UIM) claims, as all parties had active insurance.
*   No significant disputes regarding liability arose after the initial investigation.
*   No claimants pursued litigation, allowing for direct settlement negotiations.
*   No coverage gaps or endorsements that complicated eligibility.

## Examples

*   **Scenario for Liability:** If the police report was inconclusive and conflicting witness statements existed, an accident reconstruction specialist would have been engaged.
*   **Negotiation Example (Party D):** Initial demand for Party D's BI claim was $70,000. After reviewing medical records and considering established claim valuation metrics for similar injuries, an offer of $55,000 was made. Subsequent negotiation led to the final settlement of $58,000, avoiding potential litigation.
