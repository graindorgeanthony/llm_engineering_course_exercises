It applies to pet owners holding our "Premium PetCare" policy with accident and illness coverage. It explicitly excludes claims related to pre-existing conditions, routine care, or elective procedures not resulting from an accident or sudden illness.

**Deductible:** \$250 per incident
**Reimbursement Level:** 90%
**Annual Policy Limit for Accidents & Illnesses:** \$15,000
**Effective Date of Policy:** January 1, 2023
**Pre-existing Conditions:** Covered after a 12-month waiting period for specified conditions; none applicable to this acute injury.
**Waiting Period for Accidents:** 0 days (accident claims are eligible immediately upon policy activation).

## Claim Assessment and Decision Logic

1.  **Verification of Policy Status:** Policy PP001-A-004567-PI was active and in good standing on the date of the incident (September 15, 2023).
2.  **Incident Type:** The injury is confirmed as an "Accident" as defined by the policy, being sudden, unforeseen, and unintended. This falls under covered events.
3.  **Waiting Period Check:** As an accident, no waiting period applies, and the claim is eligible.
4.  **Veterinary Service Eligibility:** All listed veterinary services (consultation, diagnostics, surgery, hospitalization, medication) are standard and necessary treatments for the diagnosed condition and are covered under the "Accident & Illness" section of the Premium PetCare policy.
5.  **Medical Records Verification:** Complete medical records, including diagnostic reports, surgical notes, and billing statements from Companion Animal Hospital, were received and validated.
6.  **Expense Adjudication:**
    *   Total Veterinary Expenses: \$6,380.00
    *   Policy Deductible: \$250.00 (applied per incident)
    *   Eligible for Reimbursement: \$6,380.00 - \$250.00 = \$6,130.00
    *   Reimbursement at 90%: 90% of \$6,130.00 = \$5,517.00
7.  **Annual Limit Check:** The reimbursement amount of \$5,517.00 is well within the annual policy limit of \$15,000 for accidents and illnesses. No previous claims have been filed for Buster in the current policy period.

**Approved Payout:** \$5,517.00

## Examples
This case demonstrates the typical handling of traumatic injury claims where the incident is clearly an accident, and the veterinary care is directly related to the injury.
