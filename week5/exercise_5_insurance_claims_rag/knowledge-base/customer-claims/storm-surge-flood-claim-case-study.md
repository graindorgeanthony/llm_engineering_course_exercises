# Storm Surge Flood Claim Case Study: Hurricane Delta - Policy #FL-2021-NFIP-45678

## Overview/Purpose

This document details the adjudication of a complex flood claim stemming from Hurricane Delta, where storm surge was a primary factor. The purpose is to serve as a reference for agents and adjusters in interpreting National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) coverage for storm surge events, demonstrating common challenges and decision logic applied. This case study highlights the distinction between standard flood damage and wind-driven rain or wind damage post-surge.

## Scope

This case study pertains specifically to a residential property located in a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) and covered under a Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP) issued by the NFIP. It covers the period immediately following Hurricane Delta's landfall, focusing on damage assessment, coverage determination, and the documentation required for a storm surge-related claim. Excluded are claims involving properties outside SFHAs or policies not issued under the NFIP.

## Definitions

*   **Storm Surge:** An abnormal rise of water generated by a storm, over and above the predicted astronomical tides. This rise in water level can cause extreme flooding in coastal areas, particularly when it occurs at high tide.
*   **National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP):** A program administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) that provides flood insurance to property owners, renters, and businesses.
*   **Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP):** The specific insurance policy issued under the NFIP.
*   **Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA):** An area with a 1-percent or greater annual chance of flooding.
*   **Flood (per SFIP):** A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of two or more acres of normally dry land area or of two or more properties (at least one of which is the policyholder’s property) from:
    *   Overflow of inland or tidal waters;
    *   Unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source;
    *   Mudslide (i.e., mudflow); or
    *   Collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or similar body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels.
*   **High-Water Mark:** The visible line on structures or land indicating the maximum elevation reached by floodwaters.

## Claim Narrative

On October 9, 2020, Hurricane Delta made landfall near Creole, Louisiana, as a Category 2 hurricane. Policyholder, John and Jane Doe, residing at 123 Bayfront Drive, Grand Isle, LA (Policy #FL-2021-NFIP-45678), filed a claim on October 10, 2020, reporting significant water damage to their single-family primary residence. The property is located in a VE flood zone.

The initial report indicated water intrusion throughout the first floor, damage to appliances, flooring, and structural components. The policy had building coverage of $250,000 and contents coverage of $100,000, with a $1,250 deductible for both.

## Damage Assessment and Findings

An independent adjuster, Sarah Chen (License #LA-456789), was assigned and conducted a site visit on October 12, 2020. Key findings were:

*   **Visible High-Water Mark:** A clear high-water mark was evident on the exterior of the property at 4.5 feet above the Finished Grade Elevation (FGE). Interior high-water marks corroborated this, visible on walls, furniture, and appliances.
*   **Water Source:** Evidence strongly suggested storm surge from Barataria Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. Debris lines, sand deposits within the home, and saltwater intrusion characteristics (e.g., rusted metal, specific odor) were consistent with tidal flooding rather than inland rainfall runoff.
*   **Structural Damage:** Significant damage to the first-floor perimeter walls, insulation, drywall, and subflooring was observed. The main electrical panel, located 3 feet above FGE, showed signs of immersion.
*   **Contents Damage:** All contents on the first floor (furniture, electronics, appliances, personal effects) exhibited total loss due to saltwater immersion.
*   **Unrelated Damage:** Minor wind damage to roof shingles was noted, but attributed to the windstorm portion of the hurricane, not flood. This was explicitly excluded from the SFIP claim.

## Decision Logic and Coverage Interpretation

The adjuster applied the following NFIP guidelines for determining coverage:

1.  **Direct Physical Loss by Flood:** The evidence (high-water marks, debris, saltwater characteristics) unequivocally demonstrated that the damage was a direct physical loss caused by flood, specifically storm surge. The definition of "flood" under the SFIP includes "overflow of inland or tidal waters."
2.  **Origin of Water:** The primary source of water was determined to be storm surge. This is crucial for distinguishing between flood damage (covered) and wind-driven rain or other non-flood water damage (typically not covered by NFIP unless it originated from floodwaters).
3.  **Excluded Damage:** The wind damage to the roof was explicitly noted as not covered under the SFIP. The policyholder was advised to file a separate claim with their homeowner's wind policy. No specific evidence of wind-driven rain entering the structure *prior to or independent of* the storm surge was found. Had wind damage compromised the structure and *then* allowed rain to enter, that internal rain damage would still be excluded from the flood policy, emphasizing only direct flood damage is covered.

## Requirements/Criteria for Specific Damage

### Building Coverage

*   **Foundation & Walls:** Damage to the elevated foundation components (piers, pilings) and first-floor exterior and interior walls up to the confirmed high-water mark of 4.5 feet FGE was deemed covered. This included necessary demolition, drying, and replacement of affected drywall, insulation, and structural elements.
*   **Subflooring & Floor Coverings:** Replacement of subflooring, tile, and laminate flooring on the first floor was covered due to immersion.
*   **Mechanical & Electrical Systems:** The main electrical panel, water heater, and HVAC system (outdoor unit damaged by water; indoor air handler below high-water mark) were covered for replacement. These items must be securely anchored and installed according to local codes to be considered as building property.
*   **Appliances:** Built-in appliances (e.g., dishwasher, range, refrigerator if permanently installed) were included under building coverage.

### Contents Coverage

*   All personal property (furniture, clothing, electronics, kitchenware) on the first floor that was submerged by floodwaters up to the 4.5-foot high-water mark was covered. Depreciation was applied according to SFIP guidelines for Actual Cash Value (ACV) where applicable (e.g., furniture, electronics). Durable goods like refrigerators and washing machines were eligible for replacement cost value (RCV) less depreciation if the policy terms allowed or if explicitly defined as building property.

## Evidence/Documentation Required

The following documentation was crucial for the claim's adjudication:

*   **Proof of Loss:** Filed by policyholder on November 15, 2020, for $240,000 (building) and $90,000 (contents).
*   **Adjuster's Report:** Detailed narrative of damage, high-water mark observations, cause of loss determination.
*   **Photographic Evidence:** Extensive photos of interior and exterior damage, high-water marks, debris lines, damaged contents, and structural components.
*   **Contractor Estimates:** Licensed contractor estimates for repairs to the structure, itemizing materials and labor, submitted by December 10, 2020.
*   **Inventory of Damaged Contents:** Itemized list of damaged personal property including original purchase date, estimated replacement cost, and applied depreciation.
*   **NFIP Flood Certification/Elevation Certificate:** Documented the property's elevation relative to the Base Flood Elevation (BFE), confirming its location within the SFHA.
*   **Hydrographic Data:** Satellite imagery and local gauge data confirming storm surge levels in the area at the time of the event.

## Timelines

*   **Date of Loss:** October 9, 2020
*   **Claim Reported:** October 10, 2020
*   **Adjuster Inspection:** October 12, 2020
*   **Proof of Loss Filed:** November 15, 2020 (within 60 days of loss)
*   **Final Adjuster Report Submitted:** November 25, 2020
*   **Claim Payment Authorized:** December 20, 2020 (within 30 days of receiving Proof of Loss and all necessary documentation)
*   **Claim Appeal Period:** Policyholder has 90 days from the date of the denial or partial denial to appeal the decision. (Not applicable in this case as claim was largely approved).

## Claim Outcome

*   **Building Coverage:** Approved for $240,000 (after $1,250 deductible applied). This covered extensive structural repairs, electrical, plumbing below the high-water mark, and replacement of built-in appliances.
*   **Contents Coverage:** Approved for $88,750 (after $1,250 deductible and ACV depreciation applied). This covered the replacement of submerged personal property.

The total claim payout was $328,750. The swift resolution was largely due to clear evidence of storm surge, consistent high-water marks, and comprehensive documentation provided by the policyholder and adjuster. This case exemplifies a model for processing storm surge-related flood claims under NFIP policies, emphasizing accurate water source identification and precise high-water mark assessment.
