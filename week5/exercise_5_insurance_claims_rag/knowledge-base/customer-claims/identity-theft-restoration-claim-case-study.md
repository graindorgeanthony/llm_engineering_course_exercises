## Claim Narrative

### Discovery of Fraud (September 10, 2023)
Ms. Jane Doe, residing at 123 Maple Street, Anytown, CA 90210, discovered unauthorized activity on her Bank of America checking account (Account #XXXXXXXX5678). She noticed two suspicious transactions:
1.  September 8, 2023: $500 ATM withdrawal from an unfamiliar location (Dallas, TX).
2.  September 9, 2023: $350 online purchase from "MegaElectronics.com."
Ms. Doe confirmed with Bank of America that these transactions were not initiated by her and triggered an initial fraud investigation at the bank level.

### Initial Report and Claim Filing (September 15, 2023)
Ms. Doe contacted our claims department via phone on September 15, 2023, at 10:30 AM PST. She provided details of the fraudulent transactions and her bank’s initial assessment. A formal identity theft restoration claim (IDT-2023-09-15-001) was initiated. She completed the Identity Theft Affidavit (Form IDT-AFF-2023-001) electronically and submitted it along with copies of her driver's license and a recent utility bill for identity verification.

## Restoration Procedures and Actions Taken

### Phase 1: Immediate Protection and Reporting (September 15 - September 18, 2023)
1.  **Identity Verification:** Claimant's identity was successfully verified using provided documents.
2.  **Fraud Alert Placement:** Our Restoration Specialist, John Smith, assisted Ms. Doe in placing a 90-day fraud alert with all three major credit bureaus: Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion (confirmation numbers received).
3.  **Credit Report Review:** Assisted Ms. Doe in obtaining free copies of her credit reports from AnnualCreditReport.com and reviewed them for additional unauthorized accounts or inquiries. No other fraudulent accounts were immediately identified.

5.  **Police Report (September 18, 2023):** Advised Ms. Doe to file a police report. She filed a report with the Anytown Police Department (Case #APDR-2023-005432). A copy of the incident report was submitted to our claims department.

### Phase 2: Financial Account Remediation (September 19 - September 29, 2023)

### Phase 3: Credit and Personal Information Safeguarding (September 30 - October 30, 2023)
1.  **Communication with Creditors:** No other fraudulent accounts were identified on credit reports, thus direct communication with other creditors was not immediately required.
