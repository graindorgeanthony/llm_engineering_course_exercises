# Wind Damage to Fence Claim Case Study

## Overview/Purpose
This document presents a case study for a minor property damage claim related to wind damage to a residential fence. It outlines the claim submission, assessment process, decision logic for coverage, and the subsequent resolution, serving as a reference for handling similar incidents. The purpose is to provide agents with a practical example of claim processing for straightforward wind damage scenarios.

## Scope
This case study covers the lifecycle of a single incident claim concerning minor structural damage to a perimeter fence due to high winds. It details the steps from first notice of loss (FNOL) to claim closure. It *excludes* claims involving major structural damage to dwellings, personal injury, or damage caused by peril types other than wind. It is applicable to standard homeowner's insurance policies (HO-3) where wind is a covered peril.

## Definitions
*   **FNOL (First Notice of Loss):** The initial report made by a policyholder to their insurer regarding a loss or incident.
*   **HO-3 Policy:** A common type of homeowner's insurance policy that provides open peril coverage for the dwelling and named peril coverage for personal property.
*   **Actual Cash Value (ACV):** The cost to replace damaged property with new property of like kind and quality, minus depreciation.
*   **Replacement Cost Value (RCV):** The cost to replace damaged property with new property of like kind and quality, without deduction for depreciation.
*   **Deductible:** The amount of money the policyholder must pay toward a covered loss before the insurance company starts to pay.

## Main Content

### Case ID: WIND-FENCE-2023-01-0034
*   **Date of Loss:** January 12, 2023
*   **Date of FNOL:** January 13, 2023
*   **Policyholder:** John & Mary Smith
*   **Policy Number:** HMDL-7890123-A

### Claim Narrative
On January 13, 2023, the policyholders, John and Mary Smith, contacted ABC Insurance Co. to report damage to their wooden backyard fence. They stated that during a severe windstorm on January 12, 2023, a section of their 6-foot privacy fence collapsed due to high winds. No other property damage was reported, and no injuries occurred.

## Requirements/Criteria for Coverage

1.  **Valid Policy:** Policy HMDL-7890123-A was active and in good standing at the time of loss (January 12, 2023).
2.  **Covered Peril:** Windstorm is a covered peril under the "Dwelling and Other Structures" section of the HO-3 policy.
3.  **Direct Physical Loss:** The damage must be a direct result of the covered peril.
4.  **Damage Exceeds Deductible:** The estimated repair cost must exceed the policy deductible.

## Procedures/Steps

1.  **FNOL Intake (January 13, 2023):**
    *   Policyholder contacted claims department via phone.
    *   Agent documented claim details, date of loss, description of damage, and verified policy information.
    *   Claim number WIND-FENCE-2023-01-0034 assigned.
2.  **Assignment to Adjuster (January 13, 2023):**
    *   Claim assigned to Adjuster Sarah Lee (ID: SL789).
3.  **Initial Contact & Investigation (January 14, 2023):**
    *   Adjuster Lee contacted policyholders, explained the claims process, and scheduled an on-site inspection.
    *   Requested photos of the damage from the policyholders.
4.  **On-Site Inspection (January 15, 2023):**
    *   Adjuster Lee visited the property at 123 Oak Avenue.
    *   Confirmed damage: 3 sections (24 linear feet) of pressure-treated pine fence, approximately 6 feet tall, hadppled from their posts. Two posts were completely snapped at ground level, and one post was leaning significantly. Panel integrity of the fallen sections appeared intact, but attachment points were compromised.
    *   Measured the damaged sections and took detailed photographs.
    *   Confirmed no other concurrent damage (e.g., impact from falling trees, structural damage to the dwelling).
5.  **Estimate Generation (January 16, 2023):**
    *   Adjuster Lee prepared a repair estimate using Xactimate software.
    *   Estimate included removal of damaged sections, disposal, replacement of 3 posts, and re-attachment of existing fence panels if salvageable, or replacement of panels if non-salvageable.
    *   Estimated repair cost for material and labor: \$1,200.00.
6.  **Coverage Determination (January 16, 2023):**
    *   Based on the investigation, the damage was directly caused by high winds, a covered peril under the HO-3 policy.
    *   Policy deductible: \$1,000.00.
    *   Calculated covered amount: \$1,200.00 (RCV) - \$1,000.00 (Deductible) = \$200.00.
7.  **Communication of Decision (January 17, 2023):**
    *   Adjuster Lee contacted the policyholders to explain the estimate, the deductible application, and the resulting payout.
    *   Policyholders acknowledged and approved the settlement.
8.  **Payment Processing (January 18, 2023):**
    *   Payment of \$200.00 issued to John & Mary Smith.
9.  **Claim Closure (January 25, 2023):**
    *   Policyholders confirmed receipt of payment.
    *   Claim closed as resolved.

## Evidence/Documentation
*   FNOL Report (Digital Record)
*   Policy Declarations Page (HMDL-7890123-A)
*   Adjuster's Inspection Report with photos (January 15, 2023)
*   Xactimate Repair Estimate (WIND-FENCE-2023-01-0034-EST1)
*   Communication Log with Policyholders
*   Proof of Payment (Check No. 56789)

## Decision Logic

*   **Is damage covered?** Yes, if caused by a covered peril (wind) and policy is active.
*   **Is repairs/replacement justified?** Yes, if physical damage is verified and directly attributed to the covered peril.
*   **How to calculate payout?** (Approved Repair/Replacement Cost) - (Applicable Deductible).
*   **RCV vs. ACV:** For detached structures like fences, policies may default to ACV until repair/replacement is completed, then true up to RCV upon evidence of repair. In this case, the cost was minor and payout was upfront, assuming policyholders would repair. Policy allows for RCV up to declared value of "Other Structures".

## Timelines
*   **FNOL to Adjuster Assignment:** 1 day
*   **Adjuster Assignment to Inspection:** 2 days
*   **Inspection to Coverage Decision:** 1 day
*   **Coverage Decision to Payout:** 1 day
*   **Total Processing Time (FNOL to Payout):** 5 business days
*   **Claim Closure:** 12 calendar days from FNOL.

## Exceptions
*   If the fence was in a pre-existing state of disrepair (e.g., rotten posts, leaning prior to the storm), the claim might have been denied or adjusted for betterment/depreciation.
*   If the damage was due to impact from a falling tree originating from a neighbor's property, subrogation against the neighbor's property insurance might have been pursued.
*   If the fence was part of a shared property line, the claim would involve coordination with the neighbor and potentially their insurer. Neither of these exceptions applied in this case.
