The purpose is to serve as a reference for agents handling similar dog bite liability claims, illustrating typical claim progression, required documentation, and decision-making points.

## Incident Record and Claim Narrative

**Claim ID:** HIL-2022-DRG-0015
**Date of Incident:** October 26, 2022
**Time of Incident:** Approximately 3:30 PM PDT
**Location of Incident:** 1421 Oakwood Drive, Springfield, IL (Peterson Residence)
**Claimant:** Sarah Wilson (DOB: 1995-03-10)
**Insured:** Robert and Emily Peterson (Policy # HMP-7890123-01, effective 2022-01-01 to 2023-01-01)
**Insured Dog Description:** "Buddy," Golden Retriever, male, neutered, 3 years old, 75 lbs.

**Narrative:**
On October 26, 2022, Sarah Wilson, a delivery driver for "QuickShip Logistics," was delivering a package to the Peterson residence. Upon approaching the front porch, the Petersons' dog, "Buddy," exited through an unlatched side gate, ran towards Ms. Wilson, and bit her on the right forearm and left calf. Ms. Wilson immediately called 911. The Petersons, who were home, intervened and secured the dog. Paramedics arrived and provided initial first aid. Ms. Wilson was subsequently transported to Springfield General Hospital for further treatment.

## Coverage Specification

The Peterson's Homeowners Insurance Policy, HMP-7890123-01, includes personal liability coverage up to $300,000 per occurrence. This policy includes animal liability for domestic animals. There are no breed restrictions or prior incident exclusions applicable to "Buddy."

## Initial Claim Reporting and Investigation

**Claim Reported:** October 26, 2022, 4:15 PM PDT by Robert Peterson.
**Initial Adjuster Assigned:** David Chen
**Initial Actions (within 24 hours):**
1.  Acknowledged claim to insured.
2.  Contacted claimant to confirm details and advise on medical documentation.
3.  Requested police report (filed under incident #SGF-2022-1026-003).
4.  Requested animal control report (Springfield Animal Services, Case #AS-2022-11-007).
5.  Advised insured to secure animal and review property for maintenance issues (e.g., gate latch).
6.  Initiated medical records request authorization from Ms. Wilson.

## Evidence/Documentation Collected

*   **Police Report (SGF-2022-1026-003):** Confirmed incident details, witness statements (Peterson & Wilson), noted no prior incidents reported by either party.
*   **Animal Control Report (AS-2022-11-007):** Confirmed dog's vaccination records (current for rabies), no prior bite history, ordered 10-day home quarantine for observation. Dog found to be healthy.
*   **Medical Records (Springfield General Hospital):**
    *   Emergency Room visit, 10/26/2022: Lacerations to right forearm (3 cm) and left calf (2 cm). Wound cleaning, tetanus shot administered, prophylactic antibiotics prescribed (Amoxicillin 875mg).
    *   Follow-up visit, 11/02/2022: Wound re-examination, no signs of infection, stitches removed from forearm, partial removal from calf.
    *   Follow-up visit, 11/16/2022: All stitches removed, scarring noted on both sites. Referral to plastic surgeon for scar assessment.
*   **Plastic Surgeon Consultation Report (Dr. Anya Sharma, 12/05/2022):** Assessed scarring on forearm and calf. Recommended scar revision surgery for forearm for optimal cosmetic outcome, estimated cost $7,500. Noted calf scar would likely fade sufficiently without intervention.
*   **Photographic Evidence:**
    *   Photos of Ms. Wilson's injuries immediately after the incident (taken by paramedics and Ms. Wilson).
    *   Photos of Ms. Wilson's injuries at 1-week and 3-week post-incident (taken by Ms. Wilson).
    *   Photos of the Peterson's side gate (taken by claims adjuster David Chen).
*   **Witness Statements:** Statements from Robert and Emily Peterson regarding the incident and dog's temperament. They admitted the side gate was "sometimes left ajar."
*   **Wage Loss Documentation (QuickShip Logistics):** Documented 3 weeks of lost wages due to injury and recovery, totaling $2,100 (based on average weekly earnings of $700).

## Medical Treatment and Costs

*   **Emergency Room:** $1,850.00
*   **Follow-up Visits (2):** $300.00
*   **Medications (antibiotics, pain relievers):** $120.00
*   **Tetanus Shot:** $75.00
*   **Plastic Surgeon Consultation:** $450.00
*   **Estimated Scar Revision Surgery:** $7,500.00
*   **Total Medical Treatment (Incurred + Estimated):** $10,295.00

## Damages Claimed

1.  **Medical Expenses:** $10,295.00 (as above)
2.  **Lost Wages:** $2,100.00
3.  **Pain and Suffering:** Initially requested $30,000 by claimant's attorney.

## Decision Logic and Negotiation

**Adjuster's Initial Liability Assessment:**
*   **Negligence of Insured:** High. The unlatched gate directly contributed to the dog's escape and subsequent bite. Illinois follows a "strict liability" rule for dog bites, meaning the owner is liable if the dog attacks and causes injury without provocation. The unlatched gate further strengthens a negligence claim.
*   **Provocation by Claimant:** None evidenced. Police and witness reports confirm Ms. Wilson was merely approaching the property.
*   **Dog's History:** No prior bite history reported to authorities.
*   **Policy Coverage:** Insured's personal liability coverage applicable.

**Adjuster's Initial Offer Strategy (Pre-Settlement Conference):**
*   **Medical Expenses:** Willing to cover all documented and reasonably estimated (scar revision) medical costs.
*   **Lost Wages:** Willing to cover all documented lost wages.
*   **Pain and Suffering Multiplier:** Given the moderate nature of the physical injuries, good prognosis for recovery (especially with surgery), and absence of long-term disability, a multiplier of 1.5x to 2x incurred medicals was considered appropriate for initial negotiation. This would place an initial offer around $15,000 - $20,000 for pain and suffering.

**Negotiation Progression:**
1.  **Claimant's Initial Demand:** $42,395.00 ($10,295 medical + $2,100 lost wages + $30,000 pain & suffering).
2.  **Insurer's Initial Offer:** $27,395.00 ($10,295 medical + $2,100 lost wages + $15,000 pain & suffering).
3.  **Claimant's Counter-Offer:** $35,000.00 (reduced pain & suffering to $22,605).
4.  **Insurer's Final Offer:** $30,000.00 ($10,295 medical + $2,100 lost wages + $17,605 pain & suffering).

## Final Settlement

**Settlement Date:** January 10, 2023
**Total Settlement Amount:** $30,000.00

**Breakdown of Settlement:**
*   Medical Expenses: $10,295.00 (Including estimated scar revision)
*   Lost Wages: $2,100.00
*   Pain and Suffering: $17,605.00

**Settlement Terms:**
*   Full and final release of all claims against Robert and Emily Peterson and their insurer related to the incident of October 26, 2022.
*   Claimant agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Petersons and their insurer from any future medical liens or subrogation claims arising from the incident.

## Lessons Learned and Best Practices

*   **Prompt Investigation:** Immediate collection of police and animal control reports is crucial for establishing facts and liability.
*   **Detailed Medical Documentation:** Comprehensive medical records, including future treatment estimates, are essential for accurate valuation.
*   **Photography:** Visual evidence of injuries, property conditions, and dog's living environment significantly aids in assessment.
*   **Insured Cooperation:** Insured's honest account and cooperation in securing the animal are vital.
*   **Animal Control Records:** Critical for confirming dog's vaccination status and bite history, impacting potential liabilities and public health concerns.
*   **Policy Review:** Thorough review of policy for specific exclusions (e.g., certain breeds, prior incidents) is mandatory at the outset.
*   **Negotiation Strategy:** Establishing clear parameters for medical, lost wages, and pain & suffering components facilitates structured negotiation. Realistic pain & suffering multipliers should be applied based on injury severity and prognosis.
