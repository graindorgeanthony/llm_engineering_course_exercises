## Property Damage (PD) Claim Processing

### Motorcycle Damage Assessment
*   **Vehicle:** 2022 BMW S1000RR
*   **Mileage:** 5,500 miles
*   **Initial Appraisal:** Damages observed included bent frame, shattered fairings, damaged front fork assembly, engine casing cracks, and various cosmetic damages.
*   **Repair Estimate:** MotoTech Cycles provided an estimate of $28,500 for repairs.
*   **Actual Cash Value (ACV) Determination:** NADA Guide Clean Retail Value: $20,500. After market adjustments for accessories (exhaust, ECU tune, etc.): +$1,500. **Total ACV: $22,000.**
*   **Total Loss Decision:** Since the repair estimate ($28,500) exceeded 120% of the ACV ($22,000 * 1.20 = $26,400), the motorcycle was declared a total loss.
*   **Salvage Value:** $3,500 (Sold to Preferred Auto Salvage).

### PD Settlement
*   **Payout to Claimant:** $22,000 (ACV) - Claimant retained salvage, so ACV paid directly. Alternatively, if company takes salvage, $22,000 less deductible. In this case, Claimant retained a salvage value for $3,500 so payout was $22,000-$3,500 = $18,500, or the company took the salvage for $3,500 and paid $22,000.
*   **Claimant Decision:** Claimant opted for a full ACV payout and company takes possession of the salvage.
*   **PD Payout:** $22,000.

## Exceptions/Unique Considerations
*   **Motorcycle Specialization:** The motorcycle's unique components and high performance often lead to higher repair costs and specialized appraisal requirements compared to standard vehicles.
*   **Serious Bodily Injury:** Motorcycle accidents frequently result in more severe injuries, leading to higher medical costs and general damages. This often triggers closer scrutiny of policy limits and potential for excess exposure.
*   **Aggressive Negotiation:** Due to the significant personal impact, motorcycle claimants are often represented by legal counsel who pursue higher general damages. Requires thorough documentation and justification for settlement offers.
*   **Policy Limit Awareness:** The initial BI liability limit of $100,000 was a concern given the severity of injuries. However, the final negotiated settlement remained within limits after detailed review and negotiation without requiring excess coverage evaluation.
