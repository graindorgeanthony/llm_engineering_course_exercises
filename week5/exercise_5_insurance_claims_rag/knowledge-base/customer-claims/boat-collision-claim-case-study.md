## Incident Narrative

On October 26, 2023, at approximately 14:15 EST, the MV Mariner, while proceeding southbound in the Intracoastal Waterway, executed a starboard turn to enter a designated marina channel. Concurrently, the MV Seaworthy was proceeding northbound. According to initial reports and witness statements, the MV Mariner failed to maintain a proper lookout and yield rights of way as per navigation rules (specifically Rule 15 and 16 of the Inland Navigational Rules, applicable to crossing situations and responsibilities of the give-way vessel). The bow of the MV Mariner collided with the port quarter of the MV Seaworthy. Both vessels sustained damage. No injuries were reported.

## Damage Assessment

### MV Mariner (Insured: John A. Doe, Claim Initiated)
*   **Surveyor:** Marine Surveyors Inc. (Surveyor: David Lee)
*   **Date of Survey:** November 1, 2023
*   **Findings:**
    *   Significant impact damage to the starboard bow, extending from waterline to deck level.
    *   Fractures in fiberglass hull laminate, approximately 3 feet in length and 1.5 feet in depth.
    *   Damage to bow railing, navigation light, and anchor roller assembly.
    *   Minor cosmetic scratches along the starboard hull side, likely from rubbing post-impact.
    *   No apparent structural damage to the keel or running gear.
*   **Estimated Repair Cost:** $38,500.00 (initial estimate from Harbor Marine Services)
*   **Loss Category:** Partial Loss, Repairable.

### MV Seaworthy (Third Party: Sarah B. Smith, Claim Filed Against Doe's Policy)
*   **Surveyor:** Apex Marine Consulting (Surveyor: Emily Chen)
*   **Date of Survey:** November 2, 2023
*   **Findings:**
    *   Major impact damage to the port quarter, including hull breach above and below waterline.
    *   Crushing and delamination of hull structure in a 2.5-foot diameter area.
    *   Damage to transom-mounted stern light and adjacent rub rail.
    *   Water ingress into stern bilge compartment, but no significant damage to engines or propulsion.
    *   Minor scratching to the port engine cowling.
*   **Estimated Repair Cost:** $27,100.00 (initial estimate from Coastal Yacht Repair)
*   **Loss Category:** Partial Loss, Repairable.

## Liability Determination

### Decision Logic
Liability is determined based on the adherence to Inland Navigational Rules and findings from eyewitness accounts, vessel logbooks, and expert marine surveyor reports. The primary factors considered are:
1.  **Rule 15 (Crossing Situation):** When two power-driven vessels are crossing so as to involve risk of collision, the vessel which has the other on her own starboard side shall keep out of the way.
2.  **Rule 16 (Action by Give-way Vessel):** Every vessel which is directed to keep out of the way of another vessel shall, so far as possible, take early and substantial action to keep well clear.
3.  **Rule 5 (Look-out):** Every vessel shall at all times maintain a proper look-out by sight and hearing as well as by all available means appropriate in the prevailing circumstances and conditions so as to make a full appraisal of the situation and of the risk of collision.

### Analysis
*   **MV Mariner (John A. Doe):** Was the give-way vessel in a crossing situation (MV Seaworthy was on its starboard side). Failed to take sufficient action to keep clear. Additionally, witness statements indicate a delayed observation of the MV Seaworthy, suggesting a potential failure to maintain a proper lookout.
*   **MV Seaworthy (Sarah B. Smith):** Was the stand-on vessel. Took evasive action (hard port rudder) just prior to impact, but it was too late to avoid the collision.

### Conclusion
Based on the evidence, **100% liability is assigned to the MV Mariner (John A. Doe)** for failure to yield right-of-way and maintain proper lookout.

## Claims Processing and Resolution Steps

### MV Mariner (First-Party Claim for Damages)
1.  **Claim Filing:** John A. Doe filed a claim with Marine International P&C on October 27, 2023.
2.  **Survey & Estimate Review:** Internal adjusters reviewed David Lee's survey and Harbor Marine Services' estimate. The estimate was approved with minor adjustments.
3.  **Deductible Application:** $1,000 collision deductible applied.
4.  **Repair Approval:** Funds released to Harbor Marine Services upon signed authorization from Doe.
5.  **Subrogation:** Marine International P&C will pursue subrogation against Atlantic Marine Brokers (insurer of MV Seaworthy) for the repair costs of MV Mariner, given the 100% liability assigned to MV Mariner's owner. (Note: Due to liability determination, this is incorrect. Marine International P&C would not subrogate against the MV Seaworthy's insurer for MV Mariner's damages; they would pay their insured and then seek recovery from MV Mariner's owner, or directly from the owner if uninsured, or the MV Mariner's *liability* insurer if a third-party claim was initially made against them.)

    *Correction to process:* Marine International P&C will pay John A. Doe's repair claim for MV Mariner, less the $1,000 deductible. They will then seek recovery from John A. Doe's *liability coverage* or John A. Doe directly, as the liable party, for the damages to the MV Seaworthy and any payments made on behalf of MV Mariner that were offset by liability. If MV Mariner's policy has a collision coverage that pays regardless of fault, then Marine International P&C pays MV Mariner's claim, then seeks recovery from the liability portion of *MV Mariner's own policy* for the damages they caused to MV Seaworthy, up to the limits.

### MV Seaworthy (Third-Party Claim against MV Mariner's Liability Coverage)
1.  **Claim Filing:** Sarah B. Smith filed a third-party claim against John A. Doe on October 28, 2023. This claim was routed to Marine International P&C under MV Mariner's liability coverage.
2.  **Survey & Estimate Review:** Internal adjusters reviewed Emily Chen's survey and Coastal Yacht Repair's estimate. The estimate was approved without significant adjustments.
3.  **Payment:** Marine International P&C, as the liability carrier for MV Mariner, approved payment of the full $27,100.00 to Sarah B. Smith for the repair of MV Seaworthy. No deductible applied to the third-party claim.
4.  **Release of Liability:** Sarah B. Smith signed a release of all claims against John A. Doe and Marine International P&C upon receipt of payment.

## Repair Process

### Marine International P&C Requirements for Repairs
*   Repairs must be performed by a reputable marine repair facility with appropriate certifications.
*   Detailed repair estimates (parts, labor, materials) must be provided.
*   Before-and-after photographs of the damaged area are required.
*   Repair invoices must match approved estimates, with any deviations justified and pre-approved.
*   Final inspection by a qualified surveyor or adjuster may be required for complex repairs.

### Timelines
*   **Claim Notification:** Within 48 hours of the incident.
*   **Survey Completion:** Within 7 days of notification.
*   **Estimate Submission:** Within 3 days of survey.
*   **Estimate Approval:** Within 5 business days of submission.
*   **Repair Completion:** Dependent on scope, estimated 3-4 weeks for both vessels.
*   **Payment Processing:** Within 7 business days of repair completion and invoice submission.

## Exceptions

*   This case assumes both policies included Collision and Liability coverage sufficient to cover the damages. If either vessel were underinsured or had exclusions, the claim resolution could become more complex, potentially involving out-of-pocket expenses for the vessel owners.
*   If liability determination was split (e.g., 50/50), each insurer would be responsible for a pro-rata share of the damages, and deductibles would apply accordingly for first-party claims.
*   Had there been personal injuries, separate personal injury claims would have been initiated under the medical payments or bodily injury liability sections of the policies, subject to different evaluation criteria and processes.

## Final Resolution
Both vessels were repaired. MV Mariner's owner, John A. Doe, paid his $1,000 deductible to Marine International P&C for his own vessel's repairs. Marine International P&C subsequently paid for the full repair of MV Seaworthy's damages ($27,100.00) under MV Mariner's liability coverage. The total cost incurred by Marine International P&C for this incident was $37,500.00 (MV Mariner repairs less deductible) + $27,100.00 (MV Seaworthy repairs) = $64,600.00. The claim was officially closed on December 15, 2023.
