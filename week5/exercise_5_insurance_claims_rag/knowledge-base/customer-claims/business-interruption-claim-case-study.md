# Business Interruption Claim Case Study: "The Daily Grind" Coffee Shop Fire

## Overview
This document presents a case study of a business interruption (BI) claim filed by "The Daily Grind," a small independent coffee shop, following a fire incident. The case highlights the process of assessing lost income, applying policy coverage, and determining the final settlement amount. It serves as an example for agents managing similar BI claims, providing insight into required documentation and calculation methodologies.

## Scope
This case study covers the period immediately following a property damage event and extends through the business's restoration and reopening. It includes revenue loss, extra expenses, and the application of policy limits and deductibles. It does not delve into the property damage aspect of the claim, only its impact on business operations.

## Definitions
*   **Business Interruption (BI):** Loss of income due to direct physical loss or damage to property by a covered peril that directly prevents operations.
*   **Period of Restoration:** The period during which a business is unable to operate due to covered property damage, beginning on the date of damage and ending when the property should be repaired, rebuilt, or replaced with reasonable speed and similar quality.
*   **Actual Loss Sustained:** The actual net income (profit or loss before income tax) that would have been earned, and the normal operating expenses that continue, during the period of restoration.
*   **Extra Expense:** Necessary expenses incurred during the period of restoration that are over and above the normal operating expenses and that would not have been incurred if there had been no direct physical loss or damage to property. These expenses are incurred to minimize the suspension of business and/or to continue operations at a temporary location.
*   **Daily Value:** The daily average of business income the insured would have earned had the loss not occurred.
*   **Deductible:** The amount of loss that the insured is responsible for before the insurer pays. For BI, this is often expressed as a waiting period (e.g., 72 hours).

## Claim Narrative: "The Daily Grind"

### Initial Claim Submission
The Daily Grind submitted a claim on September 12, 2022, reporting complete cessation of operations due to the fire. They requested an immediate advance for ongoing fixed expenses.

### Key Dates
*   **DOB (Date of Business Interruption):** September 10, 2022
*   **DOR (Date of Restoration):** January 31, 2023 (Date business re-opened for full operations)
*   **Period of Restoration:** 143 days (Sept 10, 2022 - Jan 31, 2023)

## Business Interruption Loss Assessment

### 1. Determination of Pre-Loss Business Performance
StellarSure's forensic accounting team requested the following documents from The Daily Grind:
*   Profit & Loss (P&L) statements for the previous 36 months (January 2020 - August 2022).
*   Sales tax returns for the previous 3 years.
*   Bank statements and merchant processor reports for the previous 12 months.
*   Upcoming event schedules and marketing plans.
*   Lease agreement and schedule of fixed operating expenses.

Analysis of these documents established an average monthly gross revenue of $35,000 and a net income margin of 15% for the 12 months preceding the loss. Seasonal factors were identified, with Q4 historically being the strongest due to holiday sales.

### 2. Calculation of Lost Gross Revenue
The lost gross revenue was projected based on historical trends, adjusted for known factors (e.g., local economic conditions, planned promotions).

| Month       | Projected Gross Revenue (Pre-loss average + seasonal adj.) |
| :---------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| September*  | $20,000 (Partial month - 20 days lost)                     |
| October     | $38,000                                                    |
| November    | $40,000                                                    |
| December    | $45,000                                                    |
| January*    | $25,000 (Partial month - 31 days lost)                     |
| **Total**   | **$168,000**                                               |

*Adjusted for partial month interruption.

### 3. Identification of Continuing and Non-Continuing Expenses
During the interruption, The Daily Grind incurred the following continuing expenses:
*   Rent: $3,000/month
*   Salaries (Owner/Manager): $5,000/month
*   Insurance Premiums: $500/month
*   Utilities (Base connection charge): $150/month
*   Loan Payments: $1,200/month
**Total Continuing Fixed Expenses:** $9,850/month

Non-continuing expenses (e.g., hourly staff wages, cost of goods sold, variable utilities) were subtracted from the projected gross revenue.

### 4. Calculation of Actual Loss Sustained (BI)
Formula: Lost Gross Revenue - Non-Continuing Expenses + Continuing Expenses

| Period                   | Projected Gross Revenue | Non-Continuing Expenses | Continuing Expenses | BI Loss (before deductible) |
| :----------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------- | :------------------ | :-------------------------- |
| Sept 10, 2022 - Jan 31, 2023 | $168,000                | $92,400                 | $47,083             | **$122,683**                |

*(Non-Continuing Expenses calculated as 55% of projected gross revenue, based on historical COGS and variable operating costs. Continuing expenses calculated for 4.76 months (143 days).*

### 5. Application of BI Waiting Period
The policy had a 72-hour (3-day) waiting period deductible.
*   Average Daily Value of BI Loss: $122,683 / 143 days = $857.92 per day.
*   Deductible Amount: 3 days * $857.92 = $2,573.76

BI Loss after Deductible: $122,683 - $2,573.76 = **$120,109.24**

## Extra Expense Assessment

The Daily Grind incurred the following extra expenses to mitigate the loss and expedite reopening:
*   Temporary signage and marketing materials for reopening announcement: $1,500
*   Expedited shipping for replacement equipment: $750
*   Temporary rental of commercial kitchen space for staff training prior to reopening: $2,000
*   Overtime wages for staff assisting with cleanup and setup (outside of normal duties): $3,200
*   Consultant fees for fire damage recovery assessment: $1,000
**Total Extra Expenses:** $8,450

All extra expenses were deemed reasonable and necessary to minimize the period of restoration.

## Final Claim Settlement

### Decision Logic
*   **Eligibility:** The loss was due to a covered peril (fire) and resulted in a direct physical loss to property, causing an interruption of business operations.
*   **Coverage:** Business Interruption and Extra Expense coverage were active at the time of loss.
*   **Calculation:** Lost income was calculated based on historical financial records, adjusted for seasonality and continuing/non-continuing expenses. Extra Expenses were verified against invoices.
*   **Policy Limits:** The calculated BI loss ($120,109.24) was well within the $250,000 BI limit. The Extra Expenses ($8,450) were well within the $50,000 EE limit.

### Settlement Summary
1.  **Approved Business Interruption Loss:** $120,109.24
2.  **Approved Extra Expenses:** $8,450.00
3.  **Total Claim Payout:** $120,109.24 + $8,450.00 = **$128,559.24**

### Evidence/Documentation Required for Settlement
*   Signed Proof of Loss statement.
*   Detailed P&L statements for the period of restoration (showing zero or reduced revenue).
*   Invoices and receipts for all claimed Extra Expenses.
*   Bank statements confirming cessation of normal revenue deposits.
*   Forensic accounting report from StellarSure's adjusters.
*   Confirmation of reopening date from the adjuster's site visit.

## Exceptions
No significant exceptions were noted in this case study. The insured cooperated fully by providing timely and accurate documentation. There were no disputes regarding the period of restoration or the categorization of expenses.

## Lessons Learned for Future Claims
*   **Prompt Documentation:** The Daily Grind's organized financial records significantly expedited the claim assessment process.
*   **Communication:** Regular communication between the insured, the adjuster, and the forensic accountant was crucial for managing expectations and resolving queries quickly.
*   **Extra Expense Justification:** Clear documentation and justification for all extra expenses are vital for their approval. These expenses must demonstrate a direct link to minimizing BI loss.
*   **Seasonality:** For businesses with seasonal revenue fluctuations, historical data must be granular enough to accurately project lost income for specific months.
*   **Accurate Period of Restoration:** Establishing a clear, agreed-upon period of restoration is fundamental to the entire BI calculation. Any delays in repair or rebuilding must be justified as "reasonable speed."
