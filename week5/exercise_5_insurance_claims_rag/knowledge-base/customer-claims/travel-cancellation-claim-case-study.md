## Decision Logic and Criteria
The claim was assessed against the following policy clauses and criteria:

*   **Coverage Clause:** Section 3.1 "Trip Cancellation due to Medical Emergency or Sickness."
    *   **Condition:** Sudden and unforeseen illness or injury to the insured or an immediate family member.
    *   **Exclusion Check:** Review for pre-existing conditions.

2.  **Immediate Family:** Emily Smith is the daughter of the primary policyholder, qualifying as an immediate family member.
3.  **Medical Documentation:** Dr. Reed's medical report clearly states the diagnosis, date of surgery, and professional advice against travel, fulfilling the medical evidence requirement.
4.  **Non-refundable Expenses:** All submitted expenses were verified as non-refundable based on the provided cancellation confirmations and original booking terms.
5.  **Claim Timeliness:** The incident occurred on 2023-09-15, and the claim was filed on 2023-09-18, well within the 30-day notification period.
6.  **Policy Limits:** The policy TRV2023-4567 has a maximum trip cancellation benefit of $10,000.00 per insured event. The total claimed amount of $8,000.00 is within this limit.
