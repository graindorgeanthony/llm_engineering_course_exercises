*   Provide timely communication regarding policy changes and renewals.

## 6. Claims Procedures

### 6.1 Reporting a Claim
*   **Immediate Notification:** The Policyholder must notify the Insurer as soon as practicable after an accident or loss, ideally within 24-48 hours.
*   **Information Required:**
    *   Date, time, and location of the accident.
    *   Description of the incident.
    *   Names and contact information of all involved parties (drivers, passengers, witnesses).
    *   Vehicle information for all vehicles involved (make, model, license plate, VIN).
    *   Police report number, if applicable.
    *   Photographs of damage and scene (if available).

### 6.2 Investigation and Adjustment
*   The Insurer will assign a claims adjuster to investigate the loss.
*   The Policyholder must cooperate fully, providing access to vehicles, records, and relevant personnel.
*   The Insurer reserves the right to inspect damaged vehicles prior to repair authorization.

### 6.3 Settlement and Payment
*   Once liability and damages are determined, the Insurer will attempt to negotiate a settlement.
*   Payment will be made to the appropriate party (Policyholder, repair shop, third party claimant) less any applicable deductible.
*   For total losses, settlement will be based on the actual cash value (ACV) of the vehicle at the time of loss, determined by recognized valuation methods (e.g., NADA, Kelley Blue Book, market analysis).

## 7. Exceptions

### 7.1 Emergency Repairs
In cases of emergency where a covered auto is undrivable and immediate repairs are necessary to prevent further damage, the Policyholder may authorize repairs up to $1,000 without prior Insurer approval. All such repairs must be documented with receipts and reported to the Insurer within 48 hours.

### 7.2 Non-Standard Vehicles
Vehicles operating outside typical commercial uses (e.g., exotic vehicles, heavily modified vehicles, vehicles used for racing or demolition) require specific underwriting review and may be subject to unique endorsements, higher premiums, or exclusion from coverage.

## 8. Examples

### 8.1 Example of Liability Claim
A policyholder's delivery van, while making a delivery, slides on an icy road and collides with another commercial vehicle, causing significant damage to the other vehicle and minor injuries to its driver. The Policyholder’s Commercial Auto Policy would cover the property damage to the other vehicle and the bodily injury expenses of its driver, up to the policy's liability limits, after a police investigation confirms the policyholder's driver was at fault.

### 8.2 Example of Comprehensive Claim
During a severe hailstorm, a fleet of five (5) insured commercial trucks sustained significant hail damage to their roofs and hoods while parked overnight in the company's lot. The Policyholder files a comprehensive claim. The Insurer will cover the repair costs for the hail damage, minus the applicable comprehensive deductible per vehicle, as this loss was caused by a natural event, not a collision.

## 9. Decision Logic: Policy Cancellation

### 9.1 Insurer-Initiated Cancellation
The Insurer may cancel this policy for the following reasons:
*   **Non-payment of Premium:** If any premium installment is not paid by its due date, the Insurer will send a notice of cancellation providing a minimum of thirty (30) days' notice. Cancellation effective on the date specified in the notice.
*   **Material Misrepresentation:** If the Insurer discovers material misrepresentation of facts in the application or during the policy term, a notice of cancellation will be issued with thirty (30) days' notice.
*   **Increased Hazard:** If there is a substantial change in the risk originally insured that is not disclosed or mitigated, the Insurer may cancel with thirty (30) days' notice.
*   **Fraudulent Claim:** Discovery of any fraudulent claim will result in immediate cancellation, effective from the date of the fraudulent act, with appropriate notice provided.
*   **Violation of Policy Terms:** Persistent or severe violation of other policy terms and conditions, after reasonable warning, may lead to cancellation with thirty (30) days' notice.

### 9.2 Policyholder-Initiated Cancellation
The Policyholder may cancel this policy at any time by providing written notice to the Insurer. Cancellation will be effective on the date the notice is received by the Insurer, or a later date if specified in the notice. Premiums for the unexpired policy term will be refunded on a pro-rata basis, less any applicable cancellation fees.

## 10. Evidence and Documentation

The following documents may be required for policy issuance, renewal, or claims processing:
*   Commercial auto insurance application (ACORD forms, supplemental applications).
*   Certificate of incorporation or business registration documents.
*   Vehicle registration copies (for all insured vehicles).
*   Driver lists with MVR (Motor Vehicle Record) reports for each driver.
*   Lease agreements for leased vehicles.
*   Proof of prior insurance.
*   Accident reports (police reports, incident reports).
*   Repair estimates and invoices.
*   Medical records for bodily injury claims.

*   **Newly Acquired Vehicle Notification:** Within thirty (30) days of purchase (see Section 4.5).
*   **Premium Payment Grace Period:** Varies by state, typically 10-30 days before cancellation notice is issued.
*   **Policy Cancellation Notice Period (Insurer):** Minimum of thirty (30) days for non-payment or other reasons.
