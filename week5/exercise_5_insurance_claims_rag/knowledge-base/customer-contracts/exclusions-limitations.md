# General Policy Exclusions and Limitations

## Overview
This document outlines standard exclusions and limitations that apply across all insurance product lines offered by PrimeProtect Insurance, unless specifically overwritten or amended by a particular policy's terms and conditions or by endorsement. Its purpose is to clearly define circumstances and events not covered by our general insurance policies, ensuring transparency and managing expectations for all policyholders.

## Scope
This document applies to all insurance policies issued by PrimeProtect Insurance, including but not limited to, auto, property, health, life, and liability insurance. It serves as a foundational reference for interpreting coverage and limitations. Specific policy wordings or endorsements will take precedence if they explicitly amend or override any general exclusion or limitation detailed herein. This document does not create new coverage where none exists in the specific policy.

## Definitions
*   **Policyholder:** The individual or entity named in the policy declarations as the insured.
*   **Insured Event:** An event or peril specifically covered by the terms of a particular insurance policy.
*   **Exclusion:** A provision within an insurance policy that eliminates coverage for specific perils, property, or situations.
*   **Limitation:** A provision within an insurance policy that restricts the amount or type of coverage available for certain perils or situations.
*   **Pre-existing Condition:** A health condition present before the effective date of coverage for which medical advice or treatment was recommended or received.
*   **Hazardous Activities:** Activities involving a high degree of risk, including but not limited to professional sports, extreme sports, aviation (non-commercial), scuba diving, and mountaineering.

## General Exclusions

The following are standard exclusions and losses not covered across all PrimeProtect Insurance policies:

### 1. Acts of War and Terrorism
Losses or damages directly or indirectly caused by, resulting from, or in consequence of:
*   War, invasion, acts of foreign enemies, hostilities (whether war be declared or not), civil war, rebellion, revolution, insurrection, military or usurped power.
*   Acts of terrorism, defined as an act, including but not limited to the use of force or violence and/or the threat thereof, of any person or group(s) of persons, whether acting alone or on behalf of or in connection with any organization(s) or government(s), committed for political, religious, ideological or similar purposes including the intention to influence any government and/or to put the public, or any section of the public, in fear.

### 2. Nuclear Hazards and Radiation
Any loss, damage, cost or expense directly or indirectly caused by, contributed to by or arising from:
*   Ionising radiations from or contamination by radioactivity from any nuclear fuel or from any nuclear waste or from the combustion of nuclear fuel.
*   The radioactive, toxic, explosive or other hazardous properties of any explosive nuclear assemblage or nuclear component thereof.

### 3. Intentional Acts
Loss or damage arising from the intentional, willful, or fraudulent acts of the policyholder or any person acting on their behalf, or with their connivance, including but not limited to self-inflicted injury, suicide, or damage caused with malicious intent.

### 4. Illegal Acts and Contraband
Loss or damage directly or indirectly arising out of or in connection with any illegal or unlawful act committed by the policyholder or any person acting with their express or implied consent, or involving contraband.

### 5. Government Action and Confiscation
Loss or damage caused by or resulting from confiscation, nationalization, requisition, detention, seizure, appropriation, destruction or damage to property by order of any government, public or local authority or customs officials.

### 6. Wear and Tear, Gradual Deterioration, and Inherent Vice
Loss or damage caused by or resulting from:
*   Normal wear and tear, rust, corrosion, rot, decay, mold, mildew.
*   Inherent vice, latent defect, or gradual deterioration of any insured property.
*   Pest infestation (insects, rodents, vermin) unless specifically covered by an endorsement.

### 7. Pollution and Contamination
Loss, damage, injury, or liability directly or indirectly caused by or arising out of the actual, alleged or threatened discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape of pollutants, unless occurring as a direct result of a sudden and accidental insured event and specifically covered by policy endorsement. Pollutants include, but are not limited to, any solid, liquid, gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant, including smoke, vapor, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, chemicals and waste.

### 8. Cyber Incidents (General)
Unless specifically covered by a dedicated cyber insurance policy or endorsement, losses arising from:
*   Cyberattacks, data breaches, network intrusions, or any unauthorized access to or use of electronic data or systems.
*   Loss or corruption of data, denial of service attacks, or business interruption due to cyber incidents.

## General Limitations

### 1. Monetary Limits
All policies are subject to specific monetary limits (sum insured, sub-limits) as stated in the policy schedule. PrimeProtect Insurance's liability will not exceed these stated limits for any single event, aggregate period, or specific item, regardless of the actual loss sustained.

### 2. Deductibles and Excesses
All claims processed under any policy are subject to the application of the relevant deductible or excess amount as stated in the policy schedule. The policyholder is responsible for this portion of the loss.

### 3. Proof of Loss and Documentation
Coverage is contingent upon the policyholder providing all requested documentation, evidence, and proof of loss within designated timelines (typically 30-90 days from the date of loss notification). Failure to do so may result in denial of claim.

### 4. Jurisdiction and Governing Law
All policies are subject to the laws and jurisdiction of the country or state specified in the policy document. Any legal action or proceedings relating to the policy must be brought within that jurisdiction.

### 5. Other Insurance Clauses
If at the time of any loss or damage covered by a policy, there is other insurance covering the same interest, PrimeProtect Insurance will only be liable for its ratable proportion of the loss, unless otherwise specified in the policy terms (e.g., primary, secondary, excess coverage).

### 6. Notice Periods
Claims must be reported to PrimeProtect Insurance within the specified notice period (typically 72 hours for property damage, immediately for liability claims, 30 days for health claims). Failure to notify within the stipulated timeframe may prejudice the claim, especially if the delay prevents proper investigation or mitigation of loss.

## Exceptions
*   **Specific Endorsements:** Any exclusion or limitation listed here may be specifically overridden or amended by an explicit endorsement attached to a particular policy. Such endorsements must be signed by an authorized PrimeProtect Insurance representative.
*   **Mandatory Local Regulations:** In cases where local laws or regulations prohibit the enforcement of a specific exclusion or limitation, that provision will be deemed invalid only to the extent required by law, and the remainder of the policy will remain in full force and effect.

## Decision Logic
*   **Claim Validity Check:** First, verify if the reported incident falls within the scope of the specific policy type.
*   **Exclusion Review:** Cross-reference the incident details against the General Exclusions listed in this document and any specific exclusions in the policy wording. If an exclusion applies, the claim is typically denied for that specific portion or entirely.
*   **Limitation Review:** If no exclusion applies, assess the claim against General Limitations (e.g., monetary caps, deductibles, documentation requirements) and specific policy limits.
*   **Endorsement Check:** Always verify if any attached endorsements modify or remove standard exclusions/limitations for the specific policyholder. Endorsements take precedence.
*   **Ambiguity Resolution:** In cases of genuine ambiguity, the interpretation that favors the policyholder will generally apply, in line with legal principles.

## Evidence/Documentation Requirements
For any denial based on an exclusion or limitation, comprehensive documentation must be maintained, including:
*   The specific policy wording and schedule.
*   Relevant sections of this "General Policy Exclusions and Limitations" document.
*   Claim investigation reports, witness statements, or other evidence confirming the applicability of the exclusion/limitation.
*   Communication records with the policyholder regarding the decision.

## Examples

### Example 1: Intentional Act Exclusion
**Scenario:** A policyholder deliberately sets fire to their insured property to claim damages.
**Decision Logic:** The "Intentional Acts" exclusion clearly applies. The policy would not provide coverage for the fire damage.
**Outcome:** Claim denied.

### Example 2: Wear and Tear Limitation
**Scenario:** A policyholder claims for a roof leak caused by gradual deterioration and aging of materials over 20 years, without any sudden, accidental event.
**Decision Logic:** The "Wear and Tear, Gradual Deterioration" exclusion applies. This is not a sudden and accidental loss.
**Outcome:** Claim denied.

### Example 3: Cyber Incident Exclusion (without specific coverage)
**Scenario:** A small business has a standard commercial property policy and experiences a ransomware attack that encrypts all their data, causing business interruption and data recovery costs. Their property policy does not have a cyber endorsement.
**Decision Logic:** The "Cyber Incidents (General)" exclusion applies. Standard property policies do not cover losses arising from cyberattacks unless specifically added via endorsement.
**Outcome:** Claim denied.

### Example 4: Act of War Exclusion
**Scenario:** An insured commercial fleet vehicle is seized and destroyed by a hostile military force during an international conflict.
**Decision Logic:** The "Acts of War and Terrorism" exclusion applies. Losses directly resulting from war or military action are excluded.
**Outcome:** Claim denied.
