4.  **Cooperation:** The Insured must cooperate fully with the Insurer and its appointed Incident Response Team throughout the claims process, including providing access to relevant systems, data, and personnel.

## 5. Requirements and Criteria

### 5.1. General Network Security Requirements

To maintain policy validity, the Insured must implement and maintain the following minimum security controls:

*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Mandatory for all remote access and privileged accounts. Recommended for all user accounts accessing sensitive data.
*   **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)/Antivirus:** Deployed and actively managed on all endpoints (servers, workstations, mobile devices).
*   **Firewalls:** Properly configured and maintained at all network perimeters.
*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Deployed and regularly monitored for critical network segments.
*   **Regular Backups:** Critical data must be backed up at least daily, with backups stored off-site or in an isolated environment, and regularly tested for restorability (at least quarterly).
*   **Security Awareness Training:** Annual security awareness training for all employees, with documented completion records.
*   **Incident Response Plan:** A documented and tested incident response plan, reviewed and updated at least annually.
*   **Patch Management:** Critical security patches for operating systems and applications must be applied within 14 days of release, or as per documented vulnerability management procedures.

### 5.2. Eligibility for Regulatory Fines & Penalties Coverage

Coverage for regulatory fines and penalties is contingent upon the following:

*   The fine/penalty must arise directly from a privacy violation covered under this Policy.
*   The Insured must demonstrate reasonable efforts to comply with applicable data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA).
*   The Insured must not have intentionally or recklessly violated regulatory requirements.
*   The Insured must cooperate fully with regulatory investigations and provide all requested documentation.

## 6. Procedures for Incident Response

Upon reporting a potential cyber incident, the following procedures are initiated:

1.  **Initial Assessment:** The Insurer's claims team, in consultation with the Insured, will conduct an initial assessment to determine if the event qualifies as a covered cyber incident.
2.  **Incident Response Team Activation:** If covered, the Insurer will activate its pre-approved Incident Response Team. The Insured must utilize this team unless prior written approval is granted for an alternative vendor.
3.  **Forensic Investigation:** Forensic experts will investigate the cause and scope of the breach/attack to identify affected systems and data.
4.  **Legal Counsel Engagement:** Data breach legal counsel will be engaged to advise on legal obligations, notification requirements, and potential litigation.
5.  **Notification & Credit Monitoring:** Assistance will be provided for drafting and issuing mandatory notifications to affected individuals and regulatory bodies, along with arranging credit monitoring services if required.
6.  **Public Relations:** Crisis communication experts will assist in managing public and media relations to mitigate reputational damage.
7.  **Business Interruption Assessment:** If business interruption occurs, forensic accountants will assess the financial impact (loss of net profit and extra expenses).

## 7. Exceptions

*   **Emergency Vendor Selection:** In exigent circumstances where immediate action is required to prevent further damage and the Insurer's Incident Response Team cannot be immediately deployed, the Insured may engage an emergency vendor. However, prior verbal approval from the Insurer (documented via the hotline) is required, and the Insurer reserves the right to review and approve the vendor's rates and scope of work for reimbursement.
*   **Waiver of Waiting Period:** The 8-hour waiting period for Business Interruption (Cyber) coverage may be waived if the interruption is caused by a documented, nation-state sponsored cyberattack, as determined by a mutually agreed-upon forensic expert.

## 8. Examples

### 8.1. Data Breach Scenario

A marketing company, "DataCorp Inc.," experiences a ransomware attack that encrypts its customer database, containing PII for 500,000 individuals. DataCorp immediately contacts the Insurer's Cyber Incident Hotline. The Insurer activates its Incident Response Team, which includes a forensic firm, legal counsel, and a public relations specialist.

*   **Covered Costs:** Forensic investigation to determine the breach's origin and scope (\$150,000), legal advice on GDPR notification requirements (\$75,000), notification costs for 500,000 individuals (\$250,000), 24 months of credit monitoring for affected individuals (\$500,000), and public relations consultancy (\$80,000). Total Estimated Costs: \$1,055,000.
*   **Policy Application:** These costs would be covered under the "Data Breach Response Costs" section, subject to the \$10,000 retention and the \$1,000,000 per claim limit. DataCorp would pay the first \$10,000, and the Policy would cover up to \$1,000,000.

### 8.2. Business Interruption (Cyber) Scenario

A manufacturing firm, "MechCorp Ltd.," suffers a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that renders its e-commerce website and order processing systems unavailable for 72 hours. This results in a loss of sales and increased overtime for staff to manually process backlog orders.

*   **Waiting Period:** The first 8 hours of downtime would fall within the waiting period and are not covered.
*   **Covered Interruption:** The subsequent 64 hours (72 - 8) of business interruption would be covered.
*   **Covered Costs:** Loss of net profit directly attributable to the DDoS attack for 64 hours (estimated \$200,000) and extra expenses incurred (e.g., outsourced data entry, expedited shipping fees) to minimize further losses (estimated \$50,000). Total Estimated Costs: \$250,000.
*   **Policy Application:** These costs would be covered under the "Business Interruption (Cyber)" section, subject to the \$500,000 per claim limit.

## 9. Decision Logic (Claim Approval)

Claim approval is based on a multi-factor assessment:

*   **Coverage Affirmation:** The incident must clearly fall within one of the defined "Inclusions" (Section 2.1) and not be explicitly excluded (Section 2.2).
*   **Timely Reporting:** The incident must be reported within the **30-day** window as specified in Section 4.2.
*   **Compliance with Security Requirements:** The Insured must demonstrate adherence to the "General Network Security Requirements" (Section 5.1). Material non-compliance could lead to a denial of claim or a reduction in payout.
*   **Cooperation:** Full cooperation with the Insurer and the Incident Response Team is mandatory. Failure to cooperate may jeopardize coverage.
*   **Documentation:** All claims must be supported by adequate documentation (e.g., forensic reports, invoices, legal opinions, regulatory correspondence).

## 10. Evidence and Documentation

The Insured is required to provide the following documentation when filing a claim:

*   Completed Cyber Incident Claim Form.
*   Detailed narrative of the incident, including date, time, nature of attack, and observed impact.
*   Logs and technical evidence supporting the incident (e.g., firewall logs, EDR alerts, server logs).
*   Forensic investigation reports (if available or conducted by Insurer-appointed expert).
*   Invoices and receipts for all expenses being claimed.
*   Communication records with affected parties, regulatory bodies, and internal stakeholders.
*   Financial records demonstrating business interruption losses (e.g., sales reports, profit/loss statements, invoices for extra expenses).
*   Any demands made in cyber extortion cases.
*   Documentation of security controls in place at the time of the incident (e.g., firewall configuration, backup policy adherence, security awareness training records).

## 11. Timelines

*   **Claim Notification:** Within 30 days of discovery (Section 4.2).
*   **Claim Form Submission:** Within 7 days of initial notification (Section 4.2.1).
*   **Forensic Investigation Completion:** Target within 30-60 days, depending on incident complexity.
*   **Notification to Affected Individuals:** As per relevant legal requirements (e.g., 72 hours for GDPR, varying for state-specific laws).
*   **Claim Resolution:** The Insurer aims to process and resolve claims within 90 days of receiving all required documentation, assuming no disputes.
*   **Policy Renewal:** Insured will receive renewal notice 60 days prior to policy expiration.
