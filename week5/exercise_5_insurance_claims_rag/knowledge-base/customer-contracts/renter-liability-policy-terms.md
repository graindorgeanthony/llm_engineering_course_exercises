# Renter's Liability Policy Terms

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the specific terms and conditions governing the liability coverage component of the renter's insurance policy between the Insured and [Insurance Provider Name] (hereafter referred to as "the Company"). This liability coverage protects the Insured against claims arising from personal injury or property damage caused to others for which the Insured is legally responsible. Adherence to these terms is prerequisite for coverage.

## 2. Scope of Coverage

This policy provides personal liability coverage worldwide for damages arising out of the personal activities of the Insured.

### 2.1. Included Coverage

*   **Bodily Injury (BI):** Coverage for physical harm, sickness, disease, or death sustained by any person, caused by an occurrence for which the Insured is legally liable.
*   **Property Damage (PD):** Coverage for physical injury to, destruction of, or loss of use of tangible property, caused by an occurrence for which the Insured is legally liable.
*   **Medical Payments to Others:** Coverage for necessary medical expenses incurred by a person other than an Insured, due to bodily injury caused by an accident at an insured location or due to the activities of an Insured.
*   **Legal Defense:** The Company will provide a legal defense for the Insured against covered lawsuits, in addition to the limits of liability, even if the suit is groundless, false, or fraudulent, until the applicable limit of liability for damages has been exhausted by payment of a judgment or settlement.

### 2.2. Excluded Coverage

This policy does NOT cover:

*   Bodily injury or property damage arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use, loading or unloading of aircraft, motor vehicles (except certain non-motorized vehicles on the insured location), or watercraft (with specific size/power exceptions).
*   Bodily injury or property damage arising out of business pursuits or the rendering of professional services.
*   Intentional bodily injury or property damage caused by or at the direction of the Insured.
*   Losses arising from war, nuclear hazard, or government action.
*   Property damage to property owned by, rented to, or in the care, custody, or control of the Insured.
*   Communicable disease.
*   Sexual molestation, corporal punishment, or physical or mental abuse.
*   Drug-related injury or illness.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Insured:** The policyholder named on the Declarations Page, and if residents of the same household: their spouse; the relatives of either; and any other person under the age of 21 in the care of any person named above.
*   **Occurrence:** An accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions, which results in bodily injury or property damage during the policy period.
*   **Insured Location:** The residence premises described in the Declarations Page, including any associated garages or other structures; premises used by the Insured temporarily; and land owned by or rented to the Insured where a residential dwelling is being constructed.
*   **Policy Period:** The period commencing on the effective date and ending on the termination date shown in the Declarations Page.

## 4. Liability Coverage Limits

The maximum amount the Company will pay for any single occurrence, regardless of the number of Insureds, claims made, or persons injured, is specified on the Declarations Page.

### 4.1. Standard Limits

*   **Per Occurrence Limit (Bodily Injury & Property Damage Combined):** $[500,000 USD]
*   **Medical Payments to Others (Per Person):** $[5,000 USD]
*   **Damage to Property of Others (Per Occurrence):** $[1,000 USD]

### 4.2. Aggregates

Medical Payments to Others and Damage to Property of Others limits are not subject to an aggregate limit over the policy period; however, the Per Occurrence Limit for Bodily Injury & Property Damage Combined applies to each separate occurrence.

## 5. Insured's Obligations in Case of Loss

Upon occurrence of an event that may lead to a liability claim, the Insured must:

1.  **Prompt Notification:** Notify the Company or its authorized agent as soon as practicable, providing policy number, date, time, location, and a brief description of the incident.
2.  **Cooperation:** Cooperate with the Company in the investigation, settlement, or defense of any claim or suit. This includes attending hearings and trials, assisting in securing evidence and witnesses, and submitting to medical examinations if reasonably required.
3.  **No Voluntary Payments:** Not voluntarily make payments, assume any obligation, or incur any expense, other than for first aid to others at the time of the bodily injury, without the Company’s consent.
4.  **Forwarding Legal Documents:** Immediately send the Company copies of any notices, demands, summonses, or other legal papers received in connection with the occurrence.

## 6. Claims Handling and Decision Logic

### 6.1. Claim Submission

Claims must be submitted via the designated claim portal, email, or by calling the Company's claims department within 30 days of the occurrence, unless extenuating circumstances prevent timely notice.

### 6.2. Investigation Process

1.  **Initial Review:** Claims Adjuster assigned within 2 business days.
2.  **Statement Collection:** Insured, claimant, and witnesses statements gathered.
3.  **Documentation Request:** Police reports, medical records, property damage estimates, and any relevant contracts (e.g., rental agreement) requested.
4.  **Liability Assessment:** Adjuster determines legal responsibility based on collected evidence and policy terms. Key decision criteria include:
    *   Was an "Occurrence" as defined in Section 3 involved?
    *   Did the "Occurrence" result in "Bodily Injury" or "Property Damage" to a third party?
    *   Is the Insured legally liable for the "Occurrence"?
    *   Are there any applicable exclusions (Section 2.2)?
    *   Does the claim fall within "Insured Location" or "Insured" definitions?

### 6.3. Settlement or Denial

*   **Approval Criteria (Settlement):** All conditions in Section 6.2.4 are met, and the claim amount is within policy limits and deemed reasonable for the damages incurred.
*   **Denial Criteria:** Any condition in Section 6.2.4 is not met, or an applicable exclusion applies, or the Insured breaches any of their obligations in Section 5.
*   **Subrogation:** If the Company pays a claim, it retains the right to pursue recovery from any responsible third party.

## 7. Premiums and Deductibles

*   **Premium Payment:** Premiums are due on the schedule outlined in the Declarations Page. Non-payment may result in policy cancellation as per state regulations.
*   **Deductible:** Liability coverage does not typically include a deductible. However, the "Damage to Property of Others" coverage may have a specific deductible as shown on the Declarations Page. If a deductible applies, it must be paid by the Insured before the Company contributes to the loss.

## 8. General Provisions

### 8.1. Policy Changes

Any changes to this policy must be made by endorsement issued by the Company.

### 8.2. Concealment or Fraud

This policy is void if the Insured, whether before or after a loss, has intentionally concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance relating to this insurance.

### 8.3. Suit Against Us

No legal action can be brought against the Company unless there has been full compliance with all the terms of this policy. No action can be brought against the Company until the amount of the Insured's obligation to pay has been finally determined either by judgment against the Insured or by agreement made with the Company’s written consent.

### 8.4. Territory

This policy applies to bodily injury and property damage, arising out of an occurrence anywhere in the world. However, the Company's obligation to provide a defense or pay damages ceases when the applicable limits of liability are exhausted by payment of a judgment or settlement.

## 9. Exceptions

### 9.1. Emergency Medical Services

In cases requiring immediate first aid at the scene of an accident to prevent further harm, the Insured may incur reasonable expenses without prior Company consent. Such expenses must be documented and submitted to the Company for consideration of reimbursement under the "Medical Payments to Others" coverage.

### 9.2. Rental Property Damage Exception

While Section 2.2 generally excludes damage to property rented to the Insured, specific endorsements may provide limited coverage for accidental fire, smoke, and explosion damage to the dwelling rented by the Insured, up to a specified sub-limit.
