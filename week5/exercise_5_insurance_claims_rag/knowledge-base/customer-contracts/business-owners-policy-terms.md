# Business Owners Policy (BOP) Terms and Conditions

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This document outlines the comprehensive terms and conditions for the Business Owners Policy (BOP) offered by [Insurance Company Name]. The BOP is a specialized insurance package designed for small to medium-sized businesses, combining property insurance, general liability insurance, and business interruption coverage into a single, convenient policy. The purpose of this agreement is to define the coverage, exclusions, responsibilities, and procedures governing the relationship between [Insurance Company Name] (referred to as "Insurer") and the named insured (referred to as "Policyholder").

## 2. Scope of Coverage

This BOP provides coverage for direct physical loss of or damage to covered property, liability for bodily injury or property damage to third parties arising from the Policyholder's operations, and loss of business income due to covered perils.

### 2.1 Covered Property

A. **Building Property**:
    *   Buildings and structures listed in the Declarations, including additions, fixtures, machinery, and equipment permanently installed.
    *   Completed additions, outdoor fixtures, and personal property owned by the Policyholder used to maintain or service the building or premises.
    *   Property belonging to others that is in the Policyholder's care, custody, or control, up to the limits specified.

B. **Business Personal Property**:
    *   Furniture and fixtures, machinery and equipment, stock, and other personal property owned by the Policyholder and used in the Policyholder's business.
    *   Personal property of others in the Policyholder's care, custody, or control.

### 2.2 Business Liability Coverage

A. **Bodily Injury and Property Damage Liability**:
    *   Coverage for sums the Policyholder becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of "bodily injury" or "property damage" to which this insurance applies.
    *   Includes defense costs incurred by the Insurer for covered claims or suits.

B. **Personal and Advertising Injury Liability**:
    *   Coverage for sums the Policyholder becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of "personal injury" or "advertising injury" arising out of the Policyholder's business operations.

### 2.3 Business Income and Extra Expense Coverage

A. **Business Income**:
    *   Covers net income (profit or loss before income taxes) that would have been earned or incurred, and continuing operating expenses, including payroll, incurred during the "period of restoration" due to a direct physical loss or damage to covered property from a covered peril.
    *   Coverage begins 72 hours after the time of direct physical loss or damage and ends when the property should be repaired, rebuilt or replaced with reasonable speed and similar quality, or when business is resumed at a new permanent location.

B. **Extra Expense**:
    *   Covers necessary expenses incurred during the "period of restoration" that the Policyholder would not have incurred had there been no direct physical loss or damage. This is to minimize the "period of restoration" or continue operations at a temporary location.

## 3. Definitions
