# Umbrella Insurance Policy Terms

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the complete terms and conditions for the Personal Umbrella Liability Policy issued by [Insurance Company Name], hereinafter referred to as "the Company." This policy provides excess liability coverage over and above the limits of underlying primary insurance policies, such as homeowners, auto, watercraft, and recreational vehicle policies. Its purpose is to protect the insured from significant financial loss due to large liability claims or lawsuits.

## 2. Scope of Coverage
This policy applies to all named insureds as listed on the Declarations Page and provides worldwide coverage for personal liability exposures. Coverage extends to bodily injury, personal injury, and property damage for which an insured becomes legally responsible, not excluded by these terms. This policy is strictly an excess liability policy and does not provide primary coverage unless specifically stated herein for certain exposures, subject to a Self-Insured Retention (SIR).

### 2.1 Exclusions
This policy does not cover:
*   Expected or Intended Injury: Bodily injury or property damage expected or intended by an insured, even if the degree of injury or damage is different than expected or intended or is sustained by an unintended person.
*   Business or Professional Activities: Liability arising out of any business pursuits or professional services, unless specifically endorsed otherwise for incidental home-based businesses.
*   Owned Watercraft or Aircraft: Bodily injury or property damage arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use, entrustment to others, loading or unloading of any watercraft or aircraft owned by or rented to an insured, unless specifically covered by an underlying policy and this policy acts as excess.
*   Workers' Compensation: Obligations imposed upon an insured by any workers' compensation, disability benefits, or unemployment compensation law or any similar law.
*   Nuclear Liability: Liability arising out of nuclear reaction, radiation, or radioactive contamination.
*   Fiduciary Liability: Liability arising from acting in a fiduciary capacity.
*   Punitive Damages: Punitive or exemplary damages are excluded if legally uninsurable in the jurisdiction where claim arises.
*   Contractual Liability: Liability assumed by an insured under any contract or agreement, unless such liability would have existed in the absence of the contract or agreement.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Insured:** Refers to the Named Insured shown on the Declarations Page, their spouse, and any relative who resides in the Named Insured's household. It also includes persons acting as guardian or custodian of an insured.
*   **Bodily Injury:** Means bodily harm, sickness, disease, shock, mental anguish, or mental injury, including care, loss of services, and death resulting therefrom.
*   **Property Damage:** Means physical injury to, destruction of, or loss of use of tangible property.
*   **Personal Injury:** Means injury, other than bodily injury, arising out of one or more of the following:
    *   False arrest, detention, or imprisonment.
    *   Malicious prosecution.
    *   Wrongful eviction, wrongful entry, or invasion of the right of private occupancy.
    *   Slander or libel.
*   **Underlying Insurance:** Primary liability insurance policies, such as homeowners, auto, and watercraft policies, that must be maintained by the insured with specified minimum limits as a condition of this umbrella policy.
*   **Self-Insured Retention (SIR):** A deductible that applies to claims covered by this umbrella policy but not covered by any underlying insurance. The SIR must be satisfied by the insured before this policy will pay for such claims.
*   **Declarations Page:** The part of this policy that identifies the Named Insured, policy period, coverage limits, premium, and any specific endorsements or requirements.

## 4. Coverage Limits and Conditions

### 4.1 Policy Limit
The maximum amount the Company will pay for all damages, including defense costs, resulting from any one occurrence is shown on the Declarations Page as the "Each Occurrence Limit." The aggregate limit for personal injury offenses may be subject to a separate aggregate limit as specified.

### 4.2 Maintenance of Underlying Insurance
It is a condition precedent to coverage under this policy that the insured maintains underlying insurance policies with limits no less than those specified on the Declarations Page.
If underlying insurance is not maintained, or if its limits are reduced without the Company's consent, the Company will respond to a claim as if such underlying insurance were in full force and effect at the required limits. This means the Company will only pay the amount exceeding the required underlying limits, and the insured will be responsible for the gap.

### 4.3 Self-Insured Retention (SIR)
An SIR, as specified on the Declarations Page, applies to any loss covered by this policy but not covered by any underlying insurance. This SIR must be satisfied by the insured before the Company makes any payment.
*   **SIR Threshold:** Typically ranges from $250 to $10,000, as specified on the policy Declarations Page.
*   **Application:** Applies per occurrence for claims falling outside the scope or limits of underlying policies. For example, if a claim is $100,000 and the SIR is $1,000, the Company will pay $99,000 after the SIR is met.

## 5. Claim Reporting and Handling

### 5.1 Notice of Occurrence or Claim
The insured must promptly notify the Company or its authorized agent of any occurrence or claim that may involve this policy. "Promptly" means within a reasonable time, generally no later than 30 days from when the insured becomes aware of the incident, or as soon as practicable.
*   **Decision Logic for Timeliness:**
    *   **Timely Notification:** If notification is within 30 days of discovery by the insured, the claim proceeds normally.
    *   **Delayed Notification:** If notification exceeds 30 days and the Company demonstrates that such delay prejudiced its ability to investigate or defend the claim, coverage may be denied or limited to the extent of actual prejudice.

### 5.2 Cooperation
The insured must cooperate with the Company in the investigation, settlement, or defense of any claim or suit. This includes:
*   Providing written statements.
*   Attending hearings and trials.
*   Assisting in securing evidence and witnesses.
*   Submitting to a medical examination by physicians selected by the Company, at the Company's expense.

### 5.3 Defense and Settlement
When a claim against an insured is covered by this policy, the Company will:
*   Pay all expenses incurred by the Company for the investigation and defense of any claim or suit.
*   Pay the cost of appeals.
*   Pay premiums on bonds required in a suit defended by the Company for specific purposes.
*   The Company has the right to investigate and settle any claim or suit as it deems appropriate. The insured must not, except at their own expense, voluntarily make any payment, assume any obligation, or incur any expense other than for first aid, without the Company's consent.

## 6. Premium and Policy Changes

### 6.1 Premium Payment
The premium for this policy is specified on the Declarations Page and is due on or before the policy effective date and on each subsequent renewal date. Non-payment of premium will result in cancellation of the policy according to state specific regulations.

### 6.2 Changes to Policy
The terms of this policy can only be changed by a written endorsement issued by the Company. Any changes in underlying insurance, residence, drivers, or other material information relevant to the risk must be reported to the Company promptly, generally within 30 days of the change. Failure to do so may impact coverage or lead to retroactive premium adjustments.

## 7. Cancellation and Nonrenewal

### 7.1 Cancellation by Insured
The Named Insured may cancel this policy at any time by mailing or delivering advanced written notice to the Company. The effective date of cancellation will be the date specified in the notice or the date the notice is received, whichever is later. A pro-rata refund of unearned premium will be provided.

### 7.2 Cancellation by Company
The Company may cancel this policy for reasons permitted by law, including, but not limited to:
*   Non-payment of premium: 10 days' written notice.
*   Material misrepresentation: 30 days' written notice.
*   Substantial increase in risk: 30 days' written notice.
*   Fraudulent claims.
All cancellations will include a written notice of cancellation stating the reason and effective date, sent to the Named Insured at the last known mailing address.

### 7.3 Nonrenewal
The Company may elect not to renew this policy by providing the Named Insured with written notice of nonrenewal at least 60 days before the expiration date of the policy.

## 8. General Provisions

### 8.1 Assignment
The insured's rights and duties under this policy may not be assigned without the Company's written consent.

### 8.2 Subrogation
If the Company makes a payment under this policy, it has the right to recover those payments from anyone else responsible for the loss. The insured must cooperate with the Company in enforcing these rights.

### 8.3 Legal Action Against Us
No legal action can be brought against the Company unless:
*   There has been full compliance with all the terms of this policy.
*   The amount of the insured's obligation to pay has been finally determined by judgment or by written agreement signed by the Company.
This policy is intended to protect the insured and does not confer any rights or benefits to third parties unless expressly stated.

## 9. Examples of Claim Scenarios

### 9.1 Scenario 1: Auto Accident Exceeding Primary Limits
*   **Incident:** Insured causes a multi-car accident resulting in severe injuries to multiple parties.
*   **Underlying Policy:** Auto insurance policy with a $300,000 liability limit.
*   **Damages:** Total court-awarded damages and settlements amount to $1,500,000.
*   **Resolution:** The auto policy pays its $300,000 limit. This umbrella policy then pays the remaining $1,200,000, assuming it has a limit of $1,500,000 or greater. No SIR applies as an underlying policy has responded.

### 9.2 Scenario 2: Defamation Lawsuit (SIR Applies)
*   **Incident:** Insured posts damaging and false statements about a competitor online, leading to a "Personal Injury" lawsuit for slander.
*   **Underlying Policy:** Homeowners policy explicitly excludes liability for online defamation (common exclusion).
*   **Damages:** Court awards $75,000 in damages. This umbrella policy has a $1,000,000 limit and a $5,000 SIR.
*   **Resolution:** Since no underlying policy responds, the insured is responsible for the $5,000 SIR. This umbrella policy then pays the remaining $70,000.

### 9.3 Scenario 3: Dog Bite (Underlying Gap Due to Non-Compliance)
*   **Incident:** Insured's dog bites a neighbor. The insured's homeowners policy explicitly excludes liability for dog bites from specific breeds, which their dog is.
*   **Required Underlying Limit:** Declarations Page specifies homeowners liability of $500,000 must be maintained.
*   **Damages:** Neighbor is awarded $150,000. This umbrella policy has a $2,000,000 limit.
*   **Resolution:** The umbrella policy treats this as if the homeowners policy responded with its full $500,000 limit, even though it didn't pay anything due to the exclusion. Therefore, the umbrella policy will only pay the amount that *exceeds* the $500,000 required underlying limit. In this case, the umbrella policy would pay nothing, and the insured would be responsible for the full $150,000, as it falls below the deemed underlying limit.
