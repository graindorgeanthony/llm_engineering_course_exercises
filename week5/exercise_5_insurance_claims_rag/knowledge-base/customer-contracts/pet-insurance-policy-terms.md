# Pet Insurance Policy Terms and Conditions

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This document outlines the complete terms, conditions, and contractual obligations between [Insurance Company Name] (hereafter referred to as "the Company") and the Policyholder for the Pet Insurance Policy. Its purpose is to clearly define the scope of coverage, exclusions, claims procedures, and responsibilities of both parties to ensure transparency and proper administration of the insurance product. This policy is designed to help manage the financial costs associated with veterinary care due to accidents, illnesses, and specified wellness benefits for your insured pet(s).

## 2. Scope of Coverage

This policy provides coverage for eligible veterinary expenses incurred for the diagnosis, treatment, and care of specified pet(s) due to covered accidents and illnesses, and optionally, wellness services. Coverage is active only for conditions that occur and are treated while the policy is in force and after any applicable waiting periods have been satisfied.

### 2.1 Covered Pets

This policy covers dogs and cats specified by breed, age, and microchip number (if applicable) on the Declaration of Coverage document at the time of policy inception or subsequent endorsement.

### 2.2 Coverage Tiers

This policy offers three tiers of coverage:
*   **Accident-Only Plan:** Covers eligible veterinary expenses resulting from unforeseen injuries caused by accidents.
*   **Accident & Illness Plan:** Covers eligible veterinary expenses resulting from unforeseen injuries caused by accidents and veterinary diagnoses related to illnesses.
*   **Accident, Illness & Wellness Plan:** Includes all benefits of the Accident & Illness Plan, plus a fixed allowance for routine preventative care.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Accident:** An unforeseen and unintended bodily injury resulting directly and solely from an external, violent, and accidental cause. Examples include car accidents, falls, or accidental ingestion of toxic substances.
*   **Illness:** Sickness, disease, or any change in your pet's normal healthy state occurring after the waiting period that requires veterinary treatment. This includes conditions diagnosed after the waiting period, even if the onset of symptoms was subtle.
*   **Pre-existing Condition:** Any illness or injury, or symptom thereof, that occurred or was first observed by a veterinarian or the Policyholder before the policy's effective date or during any applicable waiting periods, regardless of whether a diagnosis was made or treatment received.
*   **Veterinary Expenses:** Charges by a licensed veterinarian for examinations, consultations, diagnostic tests (e.g., X-rays, blood work), surgeries, hospitalization, prescribed medications, and approved therapies directly related to a covered accident or illness.
*   **Usual, Customary, and Reasonable (UCR) Fees:** The typical range of fees charged by veterinarians in a specific geographic area for similar services. The Company will only reimburse up to the UCR fee for any covered service.
*   **Deductible:** The fixed amount of eligible veterinary expenses the Policyholder must pay per policy term before the Company begins to reimburse for covered claims.
*   **Reimbursement Percentage:** The percentage of eligible veterinary expenses (after the deductible is met) that the Company will pay.
*   **Annual Limit:** The maximum total amount the Company will reimburse for covered claims within a single 12-month policy term.
*   **Waiting Period:** The specified period of time from the policy's effective date during which certain conditions are not covered.

## 7. Procedures for Claims Submission

### 7.1 Submission Process

1.  **Obtain Medical Records:** After paying your veterinarian, obtain itemized invoices and complete medical records for the date(s) of service.
2.  **Complete Claim Form:** Fill out the Company's claim form completely, including policy number, pet details, and the reason for the visit.
3.  **Submit Documentation:** Submit the completed claim form, itemized invoices, and medical records via:
    *   **Online Portal:** [Company Website Link] (preferred method)
    *   **Email:** claims@[companydomain.com]
    *   **Mail:** [Company Claims Department Address]

### 7.2 Required Documentation

*   Completed and signed claim form.
*   Itemized invoice(s) from a licensed veterinarian, detailing services, diagnosis codes (if available), and costs.
*   Full medical records for the dates of service for which reimbursement is sought, and for the 12 months prior to the first date of service for each new condition claimed.
*   For orthopedic conditions, an orthopedic exam report (if applicable, to waive the waiting period).

### 7.3 Decision Logic & Timelines

*   **Claim Review:** Claims are reviewed by a veterinary claims specialist to determine eligibility based on policy terms, waiting periods, and exclusions.
*   **Pre-existing Condition Determination:** If a potential pre-existing condition is identified, additional medical history (up to the pet's entire medical history if needed) may be requested from previous veterinarians. Decision will be based on veterinary documentation.
*   **Processing Time:** Claims are typically processed within 10-14 business days from receipt of all required documentation. Incomplete submissions will delay processing.
*   **Reimbursement:** Approved claims are reimbursed via direct deposit or check, according to the Policyholder's chosen method, after the deductible is met and the reimbursement percentage is applied. An Explanation of Benefits (EOB) will be provided.

## 8. Exceptions

*   **Emergency Waiver of Orthopedic Waiting Period:** In rare, life-threatening emergency situations where immediate orthopedic surgery is required (e.g., severe fracture from an acute accident), the orthopedic waiting period may be waived on a case-by-case basis, pending veterinary certification of acute onset and lack of prior symptoms.
*   **Continuation of Treatment for Covered Conditions:** If a covered condition requires ongoing treatment that extends beyond the policy's renewal date, its treatment will continue to be covered under the renewed policy, subject to new deductibles and annual limits, even if the treatment plan itself was established in a prior policy term.
*   **Therapeutic Diets for Specific Conditions:** Highly specialized, short-term therapeutic diets specifically prescribed by a veterinarian for a covered illness (e.g., acute pancreatitis diet for 2 weeks) may be covered if directly attributed to the illness treatment plan and pre-approved, subject to UCR limits.

## 9. Policy Renewal and Termination

### 9.1 Renewal

The policy automatically renews annually unless terminated by either party. Premiums may be adjusted at renewal based on pet's age, claims history, and overall claims experience. The Company will provide a renewal offer at least 30 days prior to the renewal date.

The Policyholder may cancel the policy at any time by providing written notice.
*   **Within 14 days of policy inception:** Full refund of premium, provided no claims have been filed.

*   Non-payment of premium.
*   Material misrepresentation or fraud on the application or during the claims process.
