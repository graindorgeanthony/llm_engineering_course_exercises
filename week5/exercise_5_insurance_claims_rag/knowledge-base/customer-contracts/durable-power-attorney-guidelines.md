# Durable Power of Attorney Guidelines for Claims Processing

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This document outlines the guidelines and requirements for accepting and processing Durable Power of Attorney (DPOA) documents in the context of insurance claims. The purpose is to ensure that all claims handled by an appointed agent under a DPOA are managed legally, ethically, and in full compliance with company policies and relevant jurisdictional laws, while protecting the interests of both the policyholder (Principal) and the company. These guidelines aim to provide clarity for claims adjusters and legal personnel when evaluating the validity and scope of a DPOA for claim-related activities.

## 2. Scope

These guidelines apply to all claims processing personnel, legal departments, and customer service representatives involved in managing claims where a DPOA is presented. This includes all types of insurance policies administered by [Your Company Name], such as auto, property, life, and health insurance claims.

### 2.1. Inclusions

*   Evaluation of DPOA validity.
*   Identification of DPOA types and their implications for claims.
*   Authorization requirements for DPOA agents to act on behalf of a policyholder.
*   Protocols for handling financial transactions related to claims under DPOA.

### 2.2. Exclusions

*   General Power of Attorney (GPOA) without durable provisions.
*   Guardianship or conservatorship orders issued by a court (separate protocols apply).
*   Powers of Attorney specifically revoked or deemed invalid by a court order.
*   Medical Power of Attorney (unless financial decisions are explicitly included and relevant to a claim).

## 3. Definitions

*   **Durable Power of Attorney (DPOA):** A legal document that allows an individual (the Principal) to appoint another person (the Agent or Attorney-in-Fact) to make financial and legal decisions on their behalf, and which remains in effect even if the Principal becomes incapacitated.
*   **Principal:** The individual granting the power of attorney; the policyholder.
*   **Agent (or Attorney-in-Fact):** The individual designated in the DPOA to act on behalf of the Principal.
*   **Incapacity:** The inability of the Principal to make or communicate informed decisions due to mental or physical condition, as typically defined within the DPOA document or by state law.
*   **Claims-Related Activities:** Actions such as filing a claim, providing requested documentation, negotiating settlement terms, endorsing settlement checks, and communicating with [Your Company Name] regarding a claim.
*   **Springing DPOA:** A DPOA that becomes effective only upon the occurrence of a specified event, such as the Principal's incapacity.
*   **Immediate DPOA:** A DPOA that becomes effective immediately upon execution, regardless of the Principal's capacity.

## 4. Requirements for DPOA Acceptance

For a DPOA to be accepted for claims processing, the following criteria must be met:

### 4.1. Document Submission

The original DPOA document or a certified copy thereof must be submitted to [Your Company Name]'s Legal or Claims Department for review. Scanned copies may be accepted for initial review but certified copies will be required for final approval and any financial transactions exceeding $5,000.

### 4.2. Validity Checklist

All submitted DPOAs must satisfy the following validation points:

*   **Proper Execution:** Document must be signed by the Principal and dated.
*   **Witness/Notary Requirements:** Executed according to the laws of the state where it was created, typically requiring two disinterested witnesses and/or notarization.
*   **Clarity of Language:** The document must clearly name the Principal, the Agent(s), and specifically grant powers relevant to financial and legal matters.
*   **Durability Clause:** The document must explicitly state that the power of attorney is "durable" and remains effective upon the Principal's incapacity.
*   **No Expiration:** The DPOA must not have an explicit expiration date that has passed.
*   **No Revocation:** No evidence of revocation by the Principal or a court order.

### 4.3. Agent Identification

The Agent must provide valid government-issued identification (e.g., driver's license, passport) to verify identity.

### 4.4. Scope of Authority

The DPOA must explicitly grant the Agent the authority to perform financial and legal actions relevant to insurance claims, including but not limited to:

*   Filing insurance claims.
*   Communicating with insurance companies regarding claims.
*   Providing and accessing private financial or medical information pertinent to a claim (e.g., PHI waivers, financial statements).
*   Negotiating and accepting settlements.
*   Endorsing and depositing checks or other forms of payment issued by [Your Company Name].
*   Initiating or defending litigation related to claims.

If the DPOA contains ambiguous language regarding claims authority, legal counsel must be consulted.

### 4.5. Incapacity Verification (for Springing DPOA)

If the DPOA is a "springing" DPOA (i.e., it specifies that it becomes effective upon the Principal's incapacity), the following evidence of incapacity is required:

*   **Physician's Statement:** A written statement from a licensed physician confirming the Principal's incapacity to manage their financial affairs, dated within the last 90 days.
*   **Court Order:** A court order declaring the Principal incapacitated, if applicable.
*   **Other Evidence:** Any other evidence specifically outlined in the DPOA document for determining incapacity.

## 5. Procedures for DPOA Processing

### 5.1. Initial Receipt and Logging

1.  **Claim Agent:** Receive DPOA document from Agent or other party.
2.  **Claim Agent:** Log receipt of DPOA in the claims management system (e.g., "DPOA Document Received," date, submitting party).
3.  **Claim Agent:** Inform the Agent that the DPOA will be reviewed for validity and scope.

### 5.2. Legal Review

1.  **Claim Agent:** Forward the DPOA and any supporting documentation (e.g., ID, incapacity evidence) to the Legal Department or designated DPOA review specialist within 2 business days of receipt.
2.  **Legal Department:** Review the DPOA against the "Validity Checklist" (Section 4.2) and "Scope of Authority" (Section 4.4).
3.  **Legal Department:** For springing DPOAs, verify the evidence of incapacity (Section 4.5).
4.  **Legal Department:** In cases of ambiguity or concern, legal counsel may request additional information or clarification from the submitting party and/or the drafting attorney.
5.  **Legal Department:** Complete review and provide a determination (Approved, Denied, or Needs More Information) within 5 business days for standard cases, or 10 business days for complex cases.

### 5.3. Notification and Documentation

1.  **Legal Department:** Notify the originating Claim Agent of the DPOA review outcome via internal communication system.
2.  **Claim Agent:** If approved, update the claims management system to reflect that a DPOA is on file and the Agent is authorized to act on behalf of the Principal. This includes an effective date for the DPOA's use in claims.
3.  **Claim Agent:** If denied or more information is needed, communicate the specific reasons to the Agent in writing, referencing relevant company policies or legal requirements, within 2 business days of the legal determination.
4.  **All DPOA Documents:** Approved DPOAs, supporting documents, and review determinations must be securely stored in the Principal's electronic claims file.

### 5.4. Agent Interaction Protocol

*   All communication regarding the claim should primarily be directed to the authorized Agent, with copies to the Principal if capacity allows and the DPOA does not restrict such communication.
*   The Agent's authority must be re-verified periodically, especially for high-value claims or significant policy changes. Annual re-verification is standard practice for DPOAs in long-term claims.

## 6. Exceptions

*   **Emergency Situations:** In rare cases of immediate, life-threatening emergencies where a delay for DPOA review would cause irreparable harm (e.g., immediate medical treatment claim, urgent property protection), some preliminary actions may be authorized by a Claims Manager Tier 3 or higher, pending expedited legal review of the DPOA. These cases require robust documentation of the emergency and managerial override.
*   **Foreign DPOAs:** DPOAs executed outside of the United States will require additional scrutiny and may necessitate an opinion from external legal counsel specializing in international law to confirm validity and enforceability in the relevant U.S. jurisdiction. This may incur additional processing time and costs, to be borne by the Principal's estate if not covered by policy terms.
*   **Conflicting DPOAs:** If multiple DPOAs for the same Principal are presented, immediate suspension of claims action is required. The Legal Department will coordinate resolution, which may include requesting court intervention or clarification from the Principal if capable.

## 7. Examples

**Example 1: Accepted DPOA**
*   **Scenario:** Mrs. Smith presents a DPOA for her father, Mr. Jones, who is hospitalized and incapacitated. The DPOA was executed in California, is notarized, names Mrs. Smith as Agent, and explicitly states "This Power of Attorney shall not be affected by subsequent incapacity of the Principal." It grants authority to "handle all financial and legal affairs, including but not limited to insurance claims, banking, and real estate transactions." She provides a current doctor's note attesting to Mr. Jones's incapacity and her valid ID.
*   **Decision:** DPOA Approved. It meets all validity criteria and grants explicit claims-related authority.

**Example 2: DPOA Denied for Lack of Authority**
*   **Scenario:** Mr. Davis submits a DPOA for his sister, Ms. White, to process her auto insurance claim. The DPOA is validly executed but only grants authority for "healthcare decisions" and "access to medical records." It does not mention financial, legal, or insurance matters.
*   **Decision:** DPOA Denied for claims processing. The scope of authority does not extend to handling property or financial claims on behalf of Ms. White.

**Example 3: Springing DPOA Pending Incapacity Evidence**
*   **Scenario:** Ms. Lee presents a DPOA for her husband, Mr. Lee, who was recently diagnosed with early-stage dementia. The DPOA states it becomes effective "upon my physician's written determination of my incapacity." Ms. Lee has not yet provided a physician's statement.
*   **Decision:** DPOA status: "Needs More Information." Claims processing cannot proceed under DPOA until a valid physician's statement confirming Mr. Lee's incapacity is submitted and verified.
