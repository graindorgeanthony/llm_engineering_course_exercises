# Standard Auto Policy Terms and Conditions

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This document outlines the standard terms, conditions, definitions, and general provisions applicable to all basic auto insurance policies issued by Horizon Insurance Group ("the Company"). Its purpose is to clearly define the contractual relationship between the policyholder and the Company, establish the scope of coverage, and specify responsibilities and obligations of both parties. This policy serves as the foundational agreement for comprehensive, collision, liability, and other standard auto coverages.

## 2. Scope

This document applies to all new and renewal standard auto insurance policies issued to individual policyholders for private passenger vehicles. It covers vehicles primarily used for personal, family, or household purposes and not for commercial transport, livery services, or racing.

### 2.1. Inclusions:
*   Definitions of key insurance terms.
*   General policy provisions.
*   Conditions precedent to coverage.
*   Claims reporting and processing procedures.
*   Cancellation and non-renewal rules.
*   Dispute resolution mechanisms.

### 2.2. Exclusions:
*   Specific Rider or Endorsement details (these are separate documents that modify or extend these standard terms).
*   Commercial vehicle policies.
*   Motorcycle, recreational vehicle (RV), or marine policies.
*   Policies issued under specific state-mandated high-risk programs.

## 3. Definitions

The following terms, when used in this policy, shall have the meanings set forth below:

*   **Policy Period:** The period beginning and ending with the dates and times shown on the Declarations Page, during which coverage is in effect.
*   **Covered Auto:** Any vehicle shown on the Declarations Page. Also includes a newly acquired auto for a specific period as defined in Section 4.3.
*   **Insured Person:**
    *   You.
    *   Any family member residing in your household as defined in Section 3.1.
    *   Any person using your covered auto with your express or implied permission.
*   **Accident:** A sudden, unforeseen, and unintended event that results in bodily injury or property damage.
*   **Bodily Injury:** Physical injury, sickness, disease or death sustained by a person.
*   **Property Damage:** Physical injury to, destruction of, or loss of use of tangible property.
*   **Deductible:** The amount of loss in an insured event that is borne by the policyholder before the Company begins to pay.
*   **Premium:** The payment required to maintain coverage under this policy.
*   **Appraisal:** A process to resolve disputes regarding the amount of a loss.

### 3.1. Family Member:
A person related to you by blood, marriage, or adoption who is a resident of your household, including a ward or foster child.

## 4. General Provisions

### 4.1. Policy Agreement
This policy, including the Declarations Page, endorsements, and any attached riders, constitutes the entire agreement between you and the Company. No change in the policy is valid unless made by endorsement signed by an authorized representative of the Company.

### 4.2. Policy Period and Renewal
This policy is issued for the Policy Period stated on the Declarations Page. It may be renewed for successive policy periods upon payment of the required premium and acceptance by the Company. The Company reserves the right to decline renewal in accordance with state laws and Section 6.2.

### 4.3. Newly Acquired Auto
If you acquire a new private passenger auto during the Policy Period, it will be considered a "covered auto" subject to the following:
*   **Replacement Vehicle:** If the newly acquired auto replaces a covered auto, it will have the same coverage as the replaced auto from the date of acquisition. You must notify the Company within **30 days** of acquisition for the coverage to continue beyond 30 days.
*   **Additional Vehicle:** If the newly acquired auto is an additional vehicle, it will have the broadest coverage currently provided for any covered auto shown on the Declarations Page. You must notify the Company within **14 days** of acquisition and pay any additional premium required. Failure to notify within this period may result in no coverage for the additional vehicle.

### 4.4. Territory
Coverage applies only to accidents, occurrences, or losses happening within:
*   The United States of America, its territories or possessions.
*   Puerto Rico.
*   Canada.
*   Coverage is explicitly excluded for Mexico or any other country.

### 4.5. Reporting Requirements (Your Duties After an Accident or Loss)
In the event of an accident or loss, the Named Insured or an Insured Person must:
1.  Promptly notify the Company or its authorized agent of how, when, and where the accident or loss happened. Provide the names and addresses of any injured persons and witnesses.
2.  Cooperate with the Company in the investigation, settlement, or defense of any claim or suit.
3.  Submit to physical examinations by physicians selected by the Company as often as the Company reasonably requires (for bodily injury claims).
4.  Authorize the Company to obtain medical records or other pertinent records.
5.  Provide proof of loss, including documentation, receipts, or estimates as reasonably required.
6.  Permit the Company to inspect and appraise the damaged property before its repair or disposal.
7.  Take reasonable steps to prevent further damage to the covered auto.

### 4.6. Our Right to Recover Payment (Subrogation)
If the Company makes a payment under this policy, it acquires the rights of the person to whom payment was made to recover from anyone else. The Insured must cooperate with the Company and do nothing to impair these rights.

## 5. Settlement of Claims

### 5.1. Payment of Loss
The Company will pay for loss in money or, at its option, repair or replace the damaged vehicle or property. If the Company elects to repair or replace, it will do so with property of like kind and quality.

### 5.2. Appraisal
If you and the Company disagree on the amount of loss, either party may demand an appraisal. Each party will select a competent and impartial appraiser. These two appraisers will then select a third impartial umpire. If they cannot agree on an umpire, either may petition a court of record to make the selection. The appraisers will then state separately the actual cash value and the amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two of these three will be binding. Each party will pay their chosen appraiser, and bear equally the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire.

## 6. General Conditions

### 6.1. Misrepresentation and Fraud
This policy may be voided by the Company from its inception, or rescinded, if you or any Insured Person has committed fraud or intentionally concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance relating to:
*   This policy.
*   The covered auto.
*   The application for this policy.
*   Any claim made under this policy.
A material fact is one that, had the Company known about it, would have resulted in different underwriting decisions or refusal to issue the policy.

### 6.2. Suspension, Cancellation, and Non-Renewal
Your policy may be suspended, cancelled, or non-renewed according to the following criteria:

#### 6.2.1. Cancellation by You
You may cancel this policy at any time by returning the policy to the Company or by telling us the date cancellation is to take effect. If you cancel, a short-rate premium adjustment may apply.

#### 6.2.2. Cancellation by the Company
The Company may cancel this policy by mailing or delivering written notice to the Named Insured at the address shown on the Declarations Page or last known address. The notice will state the effective date of cancellation and the reason.

*   **After 60 days of a new policy or for a renewal policy:** We may cancel only for the following reasons, with at least **30 days' notice** (unless otherwise stated):
    *   Non-payment of premium (generally **10-15 days' notice** depending on state law).

The Company may elect not to renew your policy by mailing or delivering written notice to the Named Insured at the address shown on the Declarations Page or last known address. Notice will be sent at least **30 days** prior to the expiration of the Policy Period (or **60 days** in certain states). Non-renewal reasons are subject to state regulations but typically include:
*   Increased risk.
*   Claims frequency or severity.
*   Underwriting guidelines changes.

### 6.3. Transfer of Your Interest in This Policy
Your rights and duties under this policy may not be assigned to any other person or organization without our prior written consent.

### 6.4. Action Against Us
No legal action may be brought against the Company unless:
*   There has been full compliance with all terms of this policy.
*   The amount of the Insured Person's obligation to pay is finally determined either by judgment against the Insured Person after an actual trial or by written agreement of the Insured Person, the claimant, and the Company.
*   The timeframe for bringing legal action against the Company is limited by the statute of limitations applicable in the governing jurisdiction, typically **3 years** from the date of loss or denial of claim.

### 6.5. Governing Law
This policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state where the policy is issued and primarily enforced, as identified on the Declarations Page.

## 7. Evidence and Documentation Requirements

## 8. Exceptions
