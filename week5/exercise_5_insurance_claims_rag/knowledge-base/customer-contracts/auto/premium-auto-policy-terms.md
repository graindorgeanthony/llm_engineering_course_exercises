Its purpose is to provide comprehensive protection for policyholders' vehicles and liabilities, ensuring peace of mind and efficient claims processing. These terms are legally binding and supersede any conflicting provisions in standard policy documents once a Premium Auto endorsement is active.

## 2. Scope
This Premium Auto Policy applies to all vehicles explicitly listed on the policy declaration page that have been designated with a "Premium Auto" endorsement. It covers incidents occurring within the geographical limits specified in the policy, which typically include the United States, its territories, and Canada.

## 4. Main Content: Enhanced Coverage Details

### 4.1 Liability Coverage Limits
This Premium Auto Policy offers significantly higher limits for bodily injury and property damage liability. Standard minimum limits per accident are:
*   Bodily Injury: $250,000 per person / $500,000 per accident
*   Property Damage: $100,000 per accident
Policyholders have the option to increase these limits further, up to $1,000,000 combined single limit, as indicated on the policy declaration.

### 4.2 Collision and Comprehensive Coverage
*   **Collision:** Covers damage to your own vehicle resulting from a collision with another vehicle or object, or a rollover.
    *   **Deductibles:** Available options are $0, $100, $250, $500. The lowest deductible ($0 or $100) is standard for Premium Auto policies.
*   **Comprehensive:** Covers damage to your vehicle from causes other than collision, such as theft, vandalism, fire, natural disasters (hail, flood), falling objects, or impact with an animal.
    *   **Deductibles:** Available options are $0, $100, $250, $500. The lowest deductible ($0 or $100) is standard for Premium Auto policies.

### 4.3 New Car Replacement Coverage
For insured vehicles that are declared a total loss within 24 months of their original purchase date OR before accumulating 24,000 miles (whichever occurs first), SecureDrive Insurance Co. will replace the vehicle with a new vehicle of the same make, model, and trim level, or the nearest equivalent if the original is no longer manufactured. This coverage applies without deduction for depreciation and requires the lost vehicle to be originally purchased new by the policyholder. This benefit is contingent on the policyholder owning the vehicle for its entire covered duration.

### 4.4 Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Parts Guarantee
In the event of a covered collision or comprehensive claim, SecureDrive Insurance Co. guarantees the use of new OEM parts for all repairs to the Insured Vehicle, unless specific non-OEM parts are explicitly requested and approved by the policyholder and do not compromise vehicle safety or performance according to manufacturer specifications. This ensures the highest quality repair consistent with the vehicle's original condition.

### 4.5 Rental Car Reimbursement
If the Insured Vehicle is undergoing covered repairs due to a covered loss, or is declared a total loss, SecureDrive Insurance Co. will reimburse the policyholder for rental car expenses up to $75 per day, for a maximum of 45 days. This benefit commences when the vehicle is dropped off for repair or when a total loss is confirmed and ends when repairs are completed, replacement vehicle is accepted, or the 45-day limit is reached.

### 4.6 Roadside Assistance and Towing
24/7 roadside assistance is included, covering towing up to 150 miles to the nearest qualified repair facility for mechanical breakdown or accident. Other services include battery jump-start, flat tire change, fuel delivery (cost of fuel extra), and lockout services. Services beyond the 150-mile limit will be billed to the policyholder for the excess mileage.

### 4.7 Pet Injury Coverage
In the event of a covered accident resulting in injury to a dog or cat owned by the policyholder and within the Insured Vehicle at the time of the incident, SecureDrive Insurance Co. will cover veterinary expenses up to $2,000 per incident. This coverage is supplemental and does not impact claim payouts for vehicle damage.

### 4.8 Key and Remote Replacement
SecureDrive Insurance Co. will cover the cost of replacing lost, stolen, or damaged keys and remote entry fobs for the Insured Vehicle, up to $500 per incident. This benefit has no deductible.

## 5. Requirements and Criteria for Premium Auto Eligibility
Vehicles eligible for Premium Auto Policy endorsement typically meet the following criteria:
*   Vehicle age: Generally, less than 10 years old from the model year.
*   Vehicle condition: Must pass a visual inspection (photos may be required) or be new from a dealership.
*   Claim history: No more than one at-fault accident in the past 36 months for the vehicle.
*   Driver history: All listed drivers must have a clean driving record (no major violations like DUI, reckless driving in the past 5 years).
*   Vehicle value: Minimum Actual Cash Value (ACV) of $30,000 at the time of endorsement. Exceptions for classic or exotic cars may be made on a case-by-case basis.

## 6. Procedures for Claim Filing
### 6.1 Initial Notification
Policyholders must notify SecureDrive Insurance Co. at 1-800-555-5555 or via the SecureDrive mobile app as soon as reasonably possible after an incident, ideally within 24 hours.

### 6.2 Required Information for Claims
*   Date, time, and location of incident.
*   Description of the incident.
*   Names and contact information of all parties involved (drivers, witnesses, etc.).
*   Police report number, if applicable.
*   Photos or videos of the damage and scene, if available.
*   Vehicle mileage at the time of the incident.

### 6.3 Repair Authorization and Process
1.  **Damage Assessment:** For collision and comprehensive claims, SecureDrive Insurance Co. will arrange for an adjuster to assess the damage to the Insured Vehicle.
2.  **Repair Shop Selection:** Policyholders may choose their preferred repair facility. To guarantee OEM parts, SecureDrive Insurance Co. recommends using one of its certified repair shops.
3.  **Repair Approval:** SecureDrive Insurance Co. will approve repairs based on the adjuster's estimate and policy terms. Repairs requiring OEM parts will be explicitly authorized. For total loss vehicles, the New Car Replacement criteria (Section 4.3) will be applied.
4.  **Deductible Application:** The policyholder is responsible for their applicable deductible, payable directly to the repair shop or deducted from the total payout for total loss claims.

## 7. Exceptions
*   **Emergency Repairs:** In situations where immediate repairs are necessary to prevent further damage or ensure safety, policyholders may proceed with repairs up to $500 without prior authorization, provided they retain all receipts and notify SecureDrive Insurance Co. within 48 hours. Reimbursement is subject to policy terms.
*   **Commercial Use:** If a vehicle initially insured with Premium Auto is subsequently used for regular commercial taxi or ride-sharing purposes, this policy's benefits may be voided unless a specific commercial-use endorsement is added and the premium adjusted. Failure to declare commercial use could result in claim denial.

## 8. Evidence and Documentation Requirements
For all claims processes, the following documentation may be required:
*   **Accident Report:** Official police report, if available.
*   **Photos/Videos:** Visual evidence of damage and incident scene.
*   **Repair Estimates:** Itemized estimates from qualified repair shops.
