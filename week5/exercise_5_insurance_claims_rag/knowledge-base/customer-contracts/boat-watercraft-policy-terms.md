The Insured Watercraft is covered only while operating within the following geographical limits:

*   **Primary Limit:** Inland and coastal waters of the continental United States and Canada, not more than 75 miles offshore. This includes the Great Lakes.
*   **Extended Coastal Limit (Requires Endorsement):** For an additional premium, coverage can be extended to include waters up to 150 miles offshore within the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific Ocean bordering the continental U.S.
*   **Caribbean Basin (Requires Endorsement):** Specific itineraries for the Caribbean may be covered with prior approval and an additional premium.
*   **Exclusions:** Navigation in international waters beyond these limits or specified areas of known high risk (e.g., war zones, declared hurricane zones post-advisory) is excluded unless explicitly agreed upon in writing by OceanGuard Insurance Solutions prior to the voyage.

### 4.6 Towing and Assistance

Reimburses the Insured for reasonable costs incurred for towing the disabled Insured Watercraft to the nearest repair facility, jump starts, fuel delivery (cost of fuel extra), and soft ungrounding, up to $500 per occurrence. This service is for mechanical breakdowns or non-emergency situations.

## 5. Requirements and Criteria

### 5.1 Eligibility
*   The Insured must be the legal owner of the watercraft or have insurable interest.
*   Watercraft must be primarily used for recreational purposes.
*   Operators must hold valid licenses/certifications as required by law.
*   Vessel must be seaworthy at the time of policy inception.

### 5.2 Mandatory Equipment
The Insured Watercraft must be equipped with all safety equipment required by the U.S. Coast Guard, local marine authorities, and common maritime practice (e.g., life jackets, fire extinguishers, sound-producing devices, navigation lights). Failure to maintain such equipment may impact claim eligibility.

### 5.3 Operator Requirements
All operators of the Insured Watercraft must:
*   Be of legal operating age as per state and federal laws.
*   Hold any required boating safety certificates or licenses.
*   Not be under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

## 6. Procedures for Claims

### 6.1 Notice of Loss
The Insured must notify OceanGuard Insurance Solutions of any loss or damage as soon as reasonably possible, typically within 48 hours of discovery. Notification can be made via:
*   Phone: 1-800-BOAT-CLAIM (1-800-262-8252)
*   Online: www.oceanguardinsurance.com/claims
*   Email: claims@oceanguardinsurance.com

### 6.2 Claim Documentation
The following documentation **must** be provided to OceanGuard Insurance Solutions within 30 days of the loss notification:
*   Completed Claim Form (provided by OceanGuard).
*   Proof of ownership (e.g., registration, bill of sale).
*   Detailed description of the incident, including date, time, location, and circumstances.
*   Police or Coast Guard report, if applicable (e.g., theft, collision with injury).
*   Photographs of the damage and incident scene.
*   Estimates for repair or replacement from qualified marine repair facilities. At least two (2) separate estimates are required for damages exceeding $5,000.
*   Any witness statements.

### 6.3 Emergency Repairs
In situations requiring immediate emergency repairs to prevent further damage, the Insured may proceed with such repairs up to $1,000 without prior approval. Receipts and detailed explanations must be submitted with the claim. For repairs exceeding this amount, prior authorization from a claims adjuster is required, except where doing so would endanger life or property.

## 7. Exceptions

*   **Lay-up Period:** If the Insured Watercraft is laid up ashore or in a marina for an extended period (typically November 1st to April 1st in northern climates) and damage occurs during this time, a reduced deductible or broader coverage may apply, provided the policy schedules a specific lay-up period.
*   **Named Storm Advisory:** Coverage for damage caused by a named tropical storm or hurricane is generally excluded if the watercraft is within the advisory cone issued by the National Hurricane Center within 72 hours prior to the storm's landfall, and the Insured failed to take reasonable protective measures (e.g., securing, hauling out).
*   **Salvage:** In the event of a total loss, the salvage remains the property of OceanGuard Insurance Solutions unless otherwise agreed.

## 8. Examples

### 8.1 Example 1: Collision Claim
*   **Incident:** Insured's 25-foot motorboat, "Sea Serpent," collides with a submerged marking buoy in the Long Island Sound, causing significant damage to the bow and propeller. Collision occurred 10 miles offshore within the primary navigational limits.
*   **Action:** Insured immediately reports the incident, takes photos, and obtains two repair estimates totaling $12,000. Their policy has a $1,000 deductible and an Agreed Value of $75,000.
*   **Decision Logic:** This falls under Hull Coverage (Collision). Since the watercraft is a partial loss and within navigational limits, OceanGuard will cover $11,000 ($12,000 repair - $1,000 deductible).

### 8.2 Example 2: Theft Claim
*   **Incident:** Insured's personal watercraft (PWC) is stolen from their driveway in Miami. The PWC was not secured to a locked trailer or otherwise immobilized.
*   **Action:** Insured files a police report and notifies OceanGuard.
*   **Decision Logic:** The policy covers theft of the entire watercraft. However, the policy requires reasonable measures to prevent theft. If the PWC was easily accessible and not secured, the claim might be adjusted, or a higher deductible applied, or even denied if gross negligence is determined. This emphasizes the "good seamanship" clause. Police report is mandatory evidence.

### 8.3 Example 3: Navigational Limit Breach
*   **Incident:** Insured sails "Ocean Dream" from Miami to Bermuda (outside primary limits) without obtaining an Extended Coastal or Caribbean Basin endorsement. The vessel encounters heavy weather 200 miles offshore, sustaining mast damage.
*   **Action:** Insured files a claim for mast repair.
*   **Decision Logic:** Claim will be denied. The loss occurred outside the defined "Navigational Limits" without the necessary endorsement. The policy explicitly excludes coverage for events outside these stipulated zones.

## 9. Timelines

*   **Notice of Loss:** Within 48 hours of discovery.
*   **Claim Documentation Submission:** Within 30 days of loss notification.
*   **Claim Acknowledgment:** Within 3 business days of receiving initial notice.
*   **Claim Decision:** Within 15 business days of receiving all required documentation, or notification of need for additional information.
*   **Payment of Approved Claims:** Within 5 business days of claim approval.
*   **Policy Validity:** As stated in the Policy Schedule. Typically 12 months from the effective date.
