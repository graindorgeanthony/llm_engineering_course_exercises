# Classic Car Insurance Policy Terms

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This document outlines the complete terms and conditions of the Classic Car Insurance Policy ("Policy") provided by Vintage Auto Protect (VAP). The purpose of this Policy is to provide specialized insurance coverage for classic, vintage, and antique automobiles, recognizing their unique value, use, and maintenance requirements. This Policy is designed to protect policyholders against financial losses due to damage, theft, or liability related to their insured classic vehicles, based on an "Agreed Value" assessment.

## 2. Scope

This Policy applies to all classic, vintage, and antique automobiles, as defined herein, that are explicitly listed on the Policy Declarations page. It covers physical damage, theft, and third-party liability (where applicable) for these vehicles within the geographical limits specified.

### 2.1 Inclusions

*   Vehicles aged 25 years or older at the policy inception date.
*   Vehicles with a specific Agreed Value mutually determined and documented.
*   Vehicles primarily used for pleasure, exhibitions, club events, or occasional drives, not for daily commuting or commercial purposes.
*   Coverage for specialized parts and labor for repairs.

### 2.2 Exclusions

*   Vehicles used for racing, rallying (unless specifically endorsed), or off-road activities.
*   Vehicles used for daily commuting, commercial purposes, or as a primary mode of transportation.
*   Wear and tear, gradual deterioration, mechanical or electrical breakdown not resulting from a covered peril.
*   Damage arising from nuclear, biological, or chemical contamination.
*   Consequential losses not directly covered by the specified perils.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Classic Car/Vintage/Antique Automobile:** A vehicle, typically 25 years old or older, of historical interest, significant design, or collectible value, maintained in a condition that preserves its original characteristics or has been restored to a period-correct state.
*   **Agreed Value:** The monetary sum mutually agreed upon by the Policyholder and VAP at the policy inception, representing the true market value of the insured vehicle. This amount is specified on the Policy Declarations page and will be the maximum payout in the event of a total loss, less any applicable deductible.
*   **Policy Declarations:** The document issued by VAP that summarizes the specific coverages, limits, deductibles, premium, and insured vehicles for a particular policy period.
*   **Specialized Repair:** Repairs performed by technicians or facilities specifically qualified and experienced in restoring or repairing classic vehicles, often using period-correct parts or techniques.
*   **Total Loss:** A condition where the cost to repair a damaged vehicle exceeds its Agreed Value, or the vehicle is stolen and unrecovered after a specified waiting period.
*   **Claimant:** The policyholder or a third party making a request for benefits or compensation under this Policy.
*   **Deductible:** The amount of money the Policyholder is responsible for paying towards a claim before VAP's coverage begins.

## 4. Main Content: Coverage Details

### 4.1 Agreed Value Coverage

VAP agrees to insure the vehicle listed on the Policy Declarations for its Agreed Value. In the event of a total loss (due to theft or covered damage), VAP will pay the Agreed Value, less any applicable deductible. The Agreed Value is established based on professional appraisal, market comparables, and the vehicle's condition at policy inception. This value remains constant throughout the policy period unless an endorsement is issued to revise it.

### 4.2 Physical Damage Coverage (Collision & Comprehensive)

Covers direct and accidental loss to the insured classic car, including but not limited to:
*   Collision with another object or overturning.
*   Fire, theft, vandalism.
*   Falling objects, explosion, earthquake, windstorm, hail, flood, or malicious mischief.
*   Glass breakage.

### 4.3 Liability Coverage (Optional, if Selected)

Provides protection against financial losses resulting from legal liability for bodily injury or property damage to others caused by the insured classic car. Limits are specified in the Policy Declarations.

### 4.4 Roadside Assistance (Optional)

Coverage for towing, battery jump-starts, tire changes, fuel delivery, and lockout services specifically tailored for classic vehicles, ensuring care during transport.

### 4.5 Spare Parts Coverage (Optional)

Coverage for a stated value of spare parts specifically for the insured classic vehicle, stored at a declared location, against theft or damage.

### 4.6 Loss of Use / Agreed Value Rental (Optional)

In some instances, if the insured vehicle is undergoing covered repairs, VAP may offer a specified daily amount for rental of a comparable vehicle or a cash settlement for loss of use, as per endorsement.

## 5. Requirements and Criteria for Coverage

### 5.1 Eligibility Criteria

*   **Vehicle Age:** Generally 25 years or older. Exceptions for certain historically significant or limited production younger vehicles may be approved on a case-by-case basis.
*   **Vehicle Condition:** Must be in good or excellent condition, well-maintained, and free from significant rust or structural damage. Photographs and/or an appraisal may be required.
*   **Usage:** Vehicles must be for pleasure use only. Annual mileage restrictions typically apply (e.g., 2,500, 5,000, or 7,500 miles per year).
*   **Storage:** Vehicles must be stored in a secured, private garage when not in use.
*   **Driver History:** All listed drivers must have a clean driving record, typically defined as no major moving violations or at-fault accidents within the last three years.

### 5.2 Agreed Value Establishment

The Agreed Value is determined based on one or more of the following:
*   A recent independent appraisal (within the last 12 months).
*   Detailed photographs of the vehicle's interior, exterior, and engine compartment.
*   Market research by VAP valuation specialists, considering make, model, year, condition, originality, and restoration quality.
*   Proof of recent purchase or restoration costs.

### 5.3 Policyholder Responsibilities

*   Maintain the vehicle in the condition represented at policy inception.
*   Notify VAP immediately of any material changes to the vehicle's condition, usage, storage, or listed drivers.
*   Pay premiums on time.
*   Report claims promptly.

## 6. Procedures: Claim Processing

### 6.1 Reporting a Claim

1.  **Immediate Notification:** Policyholder must report any incident covered by this Policy to VAP as soon as reasonably possible, typically within 48 hours of discovery, by calling 1-800-REV-AUTO or submitting an online claim form.
2.  **Information Required:** Provide policy number, date and time of incident, location, detailed description of damage or loss, and contact information for any third parties involved.
3.  **Police Report:** For theft or vandalism claims, a police report must be filed immediately and a copy provided to VAP.

### 6.2 Claims Investigation and Assessment

1.  **Adjuster Assignment:** A VAP claims adjuster specializing in classic vehicles will be assigned to the claim within 24 hours.
2.  **Damage Assessment:** The adjuster will arrange for an inspection of the damaged vehicle. This may involve:
    *   Review of photographs provided by the policyholder.
    *   On-site inspection by a VAP-approved appraiser.
    *   Review of estimates from a VAP-approved specialized repair facility.
3.  **Specialized Repair Authorization:** For covered repairs, VAP will authorize the use of qualified classic car restoration shops. Repair methods and parts sourcing will prioritize authenticity and original specifications, using New Old Stock (NOS) parts if available, or high-quality reproductions.
4.  **Agreed Value in Total Loss:** If the vehicle is deemed a total loss, VAP will pay the Agreed Value stated on the Policy Declarations, less any applicable deductible. Salvage rights for totaled vehicles will transfer to VAP unless an agreement for policyholder retention is made.

### 6.3 Settlement

Once the damage assessment is complete and liability is determined, VAP will issue payment directly to the repair facility or the policyholder, as agreed, for covered losses, within 7-10 business days of final approval.

## 7. Exceptions

*   **Temporary Storage Change:** Minor deviations in storage location (e.g., while traveling for a car show) are generally permitted for up to 30 days, provided the temporary location is also reasonably secured (e.g., hotel garage). Policyholder must notify VAP for longer periods.
*   **Appraisal Requirement Wavier:** For vehicles with an Agreed Value below $25,000, VAP may waive the requirement for a formal independent appraisal, relying instead on provided photographs and VAP's internal valuation tools.
*   **Usage for Special Events:** Use for approved rallies or non-competitive tours may be covered with a specific endorsement and additional premium. Policyholder must submit event details to VAP for review and approval at least 14 days prior to the event.

## 8. Examples

### Example 1: Total Loss Claim for Theft
*   **Vehicle:** 1965 Ford Mustang Convertible, Agreed Value: $75,000.
*   **Incident:** Vehicle stolen from secured home garage. Police report filed.
*   **Decision Logic:** After 30 days, vehicle remains unrecovered. Policy specifies payment of Agreed Value for total loss due to theft.
*   **Outcome:** VAP pays the policyholder $75,000 (Agreed Value) minus the $500 deductible, totaling $74,500.

### Example 2: Partial Damage Claim Requiring Specialized Repair
*   **Vehicle:** 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air, Agreed Value: $60,000.
*   **Incident:** Minor collision at a car show, front fender damaged.
*   **Decision Logic:** Damage requires bodywork and paint specific to period-correct restoration. Policy covers specialized repair.
*   **Outcome:** VAP authorizes repair at "Classic Auto Body & Paint," an approved specialist. Estimated repair cost: $4,500. Policyholder pays $250 deductible, VAP pays $4,250 directly to the repair shop.
