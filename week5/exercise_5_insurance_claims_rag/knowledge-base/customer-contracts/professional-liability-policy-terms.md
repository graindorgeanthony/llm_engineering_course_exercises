# Professional Liability Policy Terms

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This document outlines the comprehensive terms and conditions governing the Professional Liability Policy (also known as Errors and Omissions or Professional Indemnity Insurance) provided by [Insurer Name]. Its purpose is to define the scope of coverage, exclusions, claims procedures, and responsibilities of both the Insured and the Insurer, ensuring clarity and transparency in the event of a covered professional liability claim. This policy is designed to protect professionals from financial losses arising from claims of negligence, errors, or omissions in the performance of their professional services.

## 2. Scope of Coverage

This policy provides coverage for claims first made against the Insured during the Policy Period, or during the Extended Reporting Period (ERP) if applicable, arising from acts, errors, or omissions in the rendering of professional services as defined herein.

### 2.1 Covered Professional Services

Coverage applies to professional services specified in the Declarations Page, typically including, but not limited to:
*   Consulting services
*   Advisory services
*   Design services
*   Analytical services
*   Fiduciary services (excluding direct management of client funds unless specified)
*   Expert witness testimony (when related to professional services)
*   Technology services (e.g., software development, IT consulting, cybersecurity advice)

### 2.2 Coverages Provided

*   **Damages and Settlements:** Payment of sums the Insured is legally obligated to pay as damages, including pre-judgment interest, resulting from a covered claim.
*   **Defense Costs:** Reimbursement for reasonable and necessary legal defense costs, charges, and expenses incurred in defending a covered claim, even if the allegations are groundless, false, or fraudulent. Defense costs are included within, and reduce, the Limit of Liability unless otherwise stated in the Declarations.
*   **Subpoenaed Witness Fees:** Reimbursement for reasonable legal fees incurred by the Insured due to responding to a subpoena for documents or testimony in connection with professional services, provided such subpoena is related to a potential covered claim.
*   **Public Relations Expenses:** Limited coverage for public relations services incurred to mitigate reputational damage directly resulting from a covered claim, subject to sub-limits specified in the Declarations.

### 2.3 Policy Period

The policy period is from the inception date to the expiration date as stated in the Policy Declarations. All covered acts, errors, or omissions must occur on or after the Retroactive Date specified in the Declarations.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Insured:** The individual, partnership, or corporation named in the Declarations Page, and any past, present, or future partners, officers, directors, or employees while acting within the scope of their duties for the Named Insured.
*   **Claim:** A written demand for monetary damages, which includes an allegation of an act, error, or omission in the rendering of Professional Services. This also includes the service of suit or institution of arbitration proceedings.
*   **Damages:** Monetary judgments, awards, or settlements, and pre-judgment interest, for which the Insured is legally liable. Damages do not include fines, penalties, taxes, punitive damages, exemplary damages, or multiplied damages, unless specifically endorsed otherwise.
*   **Professional Services:** Those services specifically described in the Declarations Page of this policy, performed by the Insured for others for a fee.
*   **Retroactive Date:** The date on or after which an act, error, or omission must occur for coverage to apply. If no Retroactive Date is specified, coverage applies only to acts, errors, or omissions occurring during the Policy Period.
*   **Extended Reporting Period (ERP):** An optional period of time following the expiration of the Policy Period during which claims first made against the Insured may be reported to the Insurer for acts, errors, or omissions that occurred on or after the Retroactive Date and prior to the end of the Policy Period.
*   **Deductible/Retention:** The amount of loss (including defense costs, if applicable) that the Insured is responsible for paying before the Insurer’s obligations commence for any covered claim.

## 4. Main Content: Coverage Details and Terms

### 4.1 Limits of Liability

The maximum amount the Insurer will pay for all damages and defense costs combined for all claims arising out of any one wrongful act, error, or omission (Per Claim Limit), and for all claims reported during the Policy Period (Aggregate Limit), as specified in the Declarations. Deductibles apply atop these limits.

### 4.2 Deductible/Retention Application

The Deductible/Retention amount specified in the Declarations Page applies to each claim. It is the Insured's responsibility to pay this amount. The Insurer may elect to pay the Deductible/Retention amount on behalf of the Insured and seek reimbursement, especially for defense costs.

### 4.3 Notice of Claim or Potential Claim

The Insured must provide written notice to [Insurer Name] at the address specified in the Declarations of any claim as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 60 days after the end of the Policy Period.
*   **Claim Reporting:** Notice must include full particulars of the claim, claimant details, alleged act, error, or omission, and copies of any demands, summonses, or legal documents.
*   **Potential Claim Reporting:** If the Insured becomes aware of circumstances that could reasonably give rise to a claim, written notice should be provided immediately. Such notice should include the specific facts, circumstances, parties involved, and estimated potential loss. If such a potential claim is reported during the Policy Period, any subsequent claim arising from the reported circumstances will be treated as if made during the Policy Period.

## 5. Exclusions

This policy does not apply to claims arising out of, based upon, or attributable to:

3.  **Submission:** Send all documentation to [Insurer Name] Claims Department via:
    *   Email: claims@[insurerdomain.com] (preferred for prompt acknowledgment)
    *   Mail: [Insurer Claims Address], [City, State, Zip Code]

### 6.2 Cooperation Clause

The Insured shall not, except at their own cost, assume any liability, admit any wrongdoing, settle any claim, or incur any expense without the prior written consent of the Insurer. Any such actions may void coverage for that specific claim.

## 7. Extended Reporting Period (ERP)

If the policy is non-renewed or canceled by either party, the Named Insured has the right to purchase an Extended Reporting Period, provided a written request and payment of the additional premium are received by the Insurer within 30 days after the end of the Policy Period.
*   **Availability:** ERP is available for 12, 24, or 36 months, or indefinitely, as specified in the policy options.

*   **Effect:** An ERP extends the period during which claims can be reported for acts, errors, or omissions that occurred before the end of the Policy Period, but it does not provide coverage for acts occurring after the Policy Period ends.

## 8. General Conditions

*   **Cancellation:**
