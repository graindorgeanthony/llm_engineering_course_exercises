# Builders Risk Insurance Policy Terms and Conditions

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This document outlines the comprehensive terms and conditions governing the Builders Risk Insurance Policy Agreement (herein referred to as "the Policy"). The purpose of this Policy is to protect owners, contractors, and other insurable parties from financial losses due to direct physical loss of or damage to property under construction. This includes coverage for the structure itself, materials, supplies, and equipment used in the construction process.

## 2. Scope

This Policy provides "all-risk" coverage, subject to specified exclusions, for new construction, renovations, and additions to existing structures.

### 2.1 Included Coverage

*   The building or structure being constructed.
*   Materials, supplies, machinery, equipment, and fixtures intended to become a permanent part of the insured project, while at the construction site, in transit to the site, or temporarily stored at an off-site location (provided such off-site storage is declared and agreed upon in the policy schedule).
*   Scaffolding, temporary structures, and forms used in the construction of the insured project.
*   Debris removal expenses for covered losses.
*   Architects' and engineers' fees incurred for redesign and re-engineering losses.
*   Testing of new machinery or equipment.

### 2.2 Excluded Coverage

This Policy does not cover losses or damages arising from:

*   Faulty materials, workmanship, or design errors where the damage is limited to the faulty part itself (this exclusion does not apply to subsequent damage to otherwise sound property resulting from such faulty parts).
*   Wear and tear, rust, corrosion, inherent vice, mold, mildew, or rot.
*   Earth movement (including earthquake, landslide, or mudslide) unless specifically endorsed and a separate premium paid.
*   Flood, surface water, waves, tidal water, overflow of streams or other bodies of water, or spray from any of these, all whether or not driven by wind, unless specifically endorsed and a separate premium paid.
*   War, military action, or civil commotion.
*   Nuclear hazard.
*   Acts of terrorism (unless specifically endorsed).
*   Contractual penalties or liquidated damages.
*   Loss of use, delay, or other consequential losses, unless specifically endorsed.
*   Tools and equipment owned by contractors or subcontractors not intended to become a permanent part of the structure.
*   Theft of materials not yet installed or secured, unless evidence of forced entry or vandalism is provided.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Insured Property:** The building or structure, including all permanent fixtures, materials, and equipment intended for permanent installation, while in the course of construction, at the described location.
*   **Construction Site:** The specific geographic location where the insured project is being built, as declared in the Policy Schedule.
*   **Course of Construction:** The period commencing from the start of groundbreaking or placement of construction materials, whichever comes first, and ending at the earlier of: (a) completion of the project, (b) occupation or use of the project, or (c) cancellation of the Policy.
*   **Occurrence:** A sudden, unforeseen, and unintended event that causes direct physical loss or damage to the insured property.
*   **Deductible:** The amount of loss or damage that the Insured is responsible for before the Policy begins to pay for a covered loss.
*   **Policy Period:** The duration for which the insurance coverage is valid, specified by a start and end date in the Policy Schedule.
*   **Substantial Completion:** When the insured property can be utilized for its intended purpose, even if minor finishing work remains.

## 4. Coverage Details and Limits

### 4.1 Property Covered

The Policy covers all materials and equipment that will become a permanent part of the structure, including:

*   Foundations and structural components
*   Framing materials (wood, steel, concrete)
*   Roofing materials
*   HVAC systems, plumbing, and electrical wiring
*   Fixtures (e.g., sinks, toilets, cabinetry)
*   Windows and doors
*   Floor and wall coverings

### 4.2 Policy Limits

Coverage is subject to the following limits, as specified in the Policy Schedule:

*   **Total Insurable Value (TIV):** The maximum aggregate amount payable for all covered losses to the insured property, typically representing the estimated completed value of the project excluding land cost.
    *   Example: For a residential build, TIV might be $500,000.
    *   Example: For a commercial build, TIV might be $5,000,000.
*   **Per Occurrence Limit:** The maximum amount payable for any single occurrence.
*   **Sub-limits:** Specific maximum amounts for certain categories of loss, such as:
    *   Debris Removal: Typically 10% of the TIV, or a stated flat amount (e.g., $25,000).
    *   Architects' and Engineers' Fees: Typically 5-10% of the TIV, or a stated flat amount (e.g., $10,000).
    *   Temporary Storage Off-Site: Up to 10% of TIV, not exceeding $100,000, contingent on prior declaration.

### 4.3 Deductibles

The following deductibles apply per occurrence, as specified in the Policy Schedule:

*   **Standard Peril Deductible:** (e.g., $1,000, $2,500, or $5,000) for losses due to fire, theft, vandalism, etc.
*   **Wind/Hail Deductible:** (e.g., 1%, 2%, or 5% of the TIV) for losses due to windstorm or hail, applied separately.
    *   *Example:* If TIV is $500,000 and the Wind/Hail Deductible is 2%, the deductible is $10,000.
*   **Named Storm Deductible:** (e.g., 2% or 5% of the TIV) for losses due to named hurricanes or tropical storms, applied separately.
*   **Flood Deductible:** (e.g., $5,000, $10,000, or 2% of TIV) if flood coverage is included.
*   **Earthquake Deductible:** (e.g., 5% or 10% of TIV) if earthquake coverage is included.

## 5. Claims Procedures

### 5.1 Notification of Loss

In the event of a covered loss or damage, the Insured must:

1.  **Notify the Insurer within 72 hours** of discovery of the loss via phone or email.
    *   Phone: 1-800-CLAIM-NOW
    *   Email: claims@insurer.com
2.  **Provide initial details:** Date of loss, description of damage, and estimated extent.
3.  **Take immediate steps** to protect the insured property from further damage. Reasonable costs incurred for such protection will be included in the loss settlement.

### 5.2 Documentation and Evidence

The Insured must provide the following documentation to support a claim:

*   **Completed Proof of Loss form:** Submitted within 60 days of the Insurer's request.
*   **Detailed inventory of damaged property:** Including quantities, descriptions, and actual cash value or replacement cost.

*   Repairs or replacement are completed promptly (within 24 months of the loss, unless extended by agreement).
*   The property is repaired or replaced with materials of like kind and quality.
*   Losses below 5% of the TIV or a maximum of $10,000 (whichever is less) may be settled without fully completing repairs, at the Insurer's discretion.

## 6. Conditions and Obligations

### 6.1 Payment of Premium

Coverage is contingent upon the timely payment of all premiums as outlined in the Policy Schedule. Failure to pay premiums may result in cancellation of the Policy.

### 6.2 Project Information Accuracy

The Insured warrants that all information provided regarding the project, including its scope, value, and construction schedule, is accurate. Material misrepresentation may void the Policy.

### 6.3 Construction Safety and Practices

The Insured must exercise due diligence in maintaining a safe construction site and adhering to all applicable building codes, regulations, and industry best practices.

### 6.4 Policy Duration and Termination

*   **Policy Period:** The Policy automatically terminates upon the earliest of:
    *   The specified policy end date.
    *   The date the project is substantially completed.
    *   The date the project is occupied or put to its intended use.
    *   The date the Insured's insurable interest ceases.
*   **Cancellation by Insured:** The Insured may cancel the Policy at any time by providing written notice. A short-rate premium refund may apply.
*   **Cancellation by Insurer:** The Insurer may cancel the Policy with 30 days' written notice for non-payment of premium or material breach of policy conditions.

## 7. Extensions and Endorsements

This Policy may be extended or modified through endorsements, subject to additional premium and mutual agreement. Common endorsements include:

*   **Testing Coverage:** For damage occurring during the testing of equipment.
*   **Contractor's Equipment Coverage:** For tools and machinery owned by the contractor.
*   **Off-Site Storage and Transit:** Expanded coverage for materials stored off the main construction site or during transport.
*   **Named Perils Inclusion:** Such as Flood, Earthquake (where not standard).
*   **Soft Costs Coverage:** For expenses incurred due to construction delays after a covered loss (e.g., interest on loans, real estate taxes, increased construction costs due to delay).
*   **Theft of Materials - Unattached:** Modifies the theft exclusion to provide limited coverage for unattached materials, subject to specific security requirements (e.g., fenced site, security cameras).

## 8. Exceptions

*   **Minor finishing work or touch-ups** after substantial completion will not automatically extend the policy term if the building is already occupied or in use. The Insured must notify the Insurer if minor work is to continue after occupancy to determine if a specific endorsement or extension is required.
*   **Expediting expenses**, defined as additional costs incurred to speed up repairs (e.g., overtime, express shipping) will only be covered if specifically endorsed to the Policy.
*   **Acts of God** are generally covered under an "all-risk" policy, except for specifically excluded perils like certain types of flood or earth movement, unless the relevant endorsements are purchased.

## 9. Examples of Claim Scenarios and Decision Logic

### 9.1 Scenario 1: Fire Damage Mid-Construction

**Event:** A fire breaks out on the second floor of a new residential building during framing, causing extensive damage to recently installed lumber and some structural components.
**Decision Logic:**
1.  **Verify Policy Period:** Was the fire within the active policy period and before substantial completion/occupancy? (Yes)
2.  **Verify Cause of Loss:** Fire is a generally covered peril under 'all-risk'. (Yes)
3.  **Deductible Application:** Apply the Standard Peril Deductible as stated in the Policy Schedule (e.g., $2,500).
4.  **Coverage Scope:** Covered items include damaged framing, lumber, and any other materials intended to be part of the structure.
5.  **Settlement:** Loss will be settled on a replacement cost basis, subject to the TIV and per occurrence limits, for the reasonable cost to repair/replace the damaged sections. Debris removal costs for burnt materials would also be covered up to the sub-limit.

### 9.2 Scenario 2: Theft of Copper Wiring

**Event:** Overnight, unknown individuals break into a construction site fence and steal all recently installed copper wiring from a multi-unit residential project. No forced entry into the building itself, only the site perimeter.
**Decision Logic:**
1.  **Verify Policy Period:** Was the theft within the active policy period? (Yes)
2.  **Verify Cause of Loss:** Theft is generally covered. However, the standard exclusion for "theft of materials not yet installed or secured, unless evidence of forced entry or vandalism" applies to internal building breaches.
3.  **Perimeter Security:** Was there evidence of forced entry to the *site perimeter* (e.g., cut fence)? (Yes, broken fence)
4.  **Coverage Scope:** Copper wiring is a material intended to be a permanent part of the structure.
5.  **Endorsement Check:** Does the policy include the "Theft of Materials - Unattached" endorsement?
    *   **If Yes:** And specific security criteria (e.g., fenced site, presence of security cameras if required by endorsement) were met, the loss is likely covered up to the endorsement's sub-limit (e.g., $25,000 for unattached materials).
    *   **If No:** The exclusion for "theft of materials not yet installed or secured" would likely apply, leading to denial of the claim, as the stolen items were unattached, and the forced entry was to the site, not *into* the building where the materials were housed. The standard wording typically requires forced entry *to the direct storage or project itself*.

### 9.3 Scenario 3: Design Error Leading to Collapse

**Event:** After a heavy rain, a section of an unsupported concrete slab collapses due to an error in the structural design calculations, damaging adjacent, properly constructed framing.
**Decision Logic:**
1.  **Verify Policy Period:** Was the collapse within the active policy period? (Yes)
2.  **Verify Cause of Loss:** "Faulty materials, workmanship, or design errors where the damage is limited to the faulty part itself" is an exclusion.
3.  **Application of Exclusion:**
    *   The cost to redesign and replace the faulty concrete slab *itself* would be excluded under the faulty design exclusion.
    *   However, the exclusion states it "does not apply to subsequent damage to otherwise sound property resulting from such faulty parts." Therefore, damage to the *adjacent, properly constructed framing* caused by the slab collapse would be covered.
4.  **Deductible Application:** The Standard Peril Deductible would apply to the covered portion of the loss (damage to the framing).
5.  **Settlement:** The policy would pay for the repair/replacement of the damaged framing, subject to policy limits and deductible. The cost to redesign and replace the faulty concrete slab would be borne by the responsible design professional or contractor.
