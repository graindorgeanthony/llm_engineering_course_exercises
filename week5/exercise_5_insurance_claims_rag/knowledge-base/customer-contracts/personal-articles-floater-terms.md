# Personal Articles Floater Policy Terms

## Overview
This document outlines the contractual terms and conditions for the Personal Articles Floater (PAF) policy, which provides specialized coverage for high-value personal property that may have limited or no coverage under a standard homeowner's or renter's insurance policy. This floater extends coverage to specific items listed on the Declarations Page, protecting them against a broader range of perils and often with no deductible.

## Scope
This policy covers specified personal articles, individually listed and appraised, located anywhere in the world. This includes items such as jewelry, furs, fine arts, cameras, musical instruments, coin collections, stamp collections, and other valuable articles as agreed upon by the Insured and the Company.

### Inclusions:
*   Specified items listed on the Declarations Page.
*   Coverage for perils typically excluded by standard policies (e.g., mysterious disappearance, transit damage).
*   Worldwide coverage.

### Exclusions:
*   Items not specifically listed and valued on the Declarations Page.
*   Loss or damage due to wear and tear, inherent vice, deterioration, moths, vermin, or repair/restoration processes.
*   Loss or damage due to nuclear hazard, war, or governmental confiscation.
*   Items used for commercial purposes without explicit endorsement.
*   Losses outside the agreed-upon coverage limits for each item.

## Definitions
*   **Insured:** The policyholder named on the Declarations Page, and if residents of the same household, his or her spouse, relatives, and other persons under the age of 21 in the care of any insured.
*   **Company:** The issuing insurance entity.
*   **Personal Article Floater (PAF):** An insurance policy that covers specified personal property, often valuable items, against specific perils on an "all-risk" or "named-peril" basis.
*   **Declarations Page:** The part of the policy that specifies the named insured, policy period, premium, and itemized list of articles covered with their respective limits.
*   **Scheduled Property:** Individual items specifically listed and valued on the Declarations Page.
*   **Appraisal:** A professional assessment of an item's market value, often required for high-value items to establish the amount of coverage.
*   **Mysterious Disappearance:** A loss where the circumstances of the disappearance are unknown, and there is no evidence of theft or other covered peril.
*   **Agreed Value:** The value of an insured item as agreed upon by the insurer and insured at the time the policy is issued, which will be paid in the event of a total covered loss.

## Coverage Details

### Types of Covered Property
Coverage is provided for the following categories, when scheduled:
1.  **Jewelry:** Includes rings, watches, necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and other precious metal or gemstone items.
2.  **Furs:** Includes fur coats, stoles, jackets, and other fur garments.
3.  **Fine Arts:** Includes paintings, sculptures, rare books, and other art objects of rarity or aesthetic merit. Coverage is typically on an "Agreed Value" basis.
4.  **Cameras & Photographic Equipment:** Includes digital and film cameras, lenses, tripods, lighting equipment, and drones.
5.  **Musical Instruments:** Includes professional and amateur instruments, bows, cases, and related equipment.
6.  **Coin Collections:** Includes individual coins, sets, and paper currency collections.
7.  **Stamp Collections:** Includes individual stamps, sheets, and philatelic materials.
8.  **Silverware:** Sterling silver or silver-plated flatware and hollowware.
9.  **Golf Equipment:** Clubs, bags, and associated gear.
10. **Antiques & Collectibles:** Other unique or valuable items specifically agreed upon.

### Perils Covered
Coverage is generally provided on an "all-risk" basis for scheduled property, meaning it covers all direct physical loss or damage from any cause, except those specifically excluded. Common covered perils include:
*   Fire, lightning, windstorm, hail
*   Theft, burglary, vandalism
*   Mysterious disappearance
*   Accidental breakage
*   Water damage (burst pipes, overflow)
*   Damage in transit

### Valuation and Limits
*   **Jewelry, Furs, Cameras, Musical Instruments, Silverware, Golf Equipment:** Covered for the lesser of the actual cash value at the time of loss, the cost to repair or replace, or the amount scheduled for the item on the Declarations Page. For items requiring an appraisal, the scheduled amount is typically the appraised value.
*   **Fine Arts:** Covered on an "Agreed Value" basis, meaning the amount scheduled for the item on the Declarations Page will be paid in the event of a total covered loss, without depreciation.
*   **Coin and Stamp Collections:** Coverage is limited to the value scheduled for the collection, or for individual items within the collection if they are separately scheduled. Losses for unscheduled individual coins/stamps within a scheduled collection may be subject to specific sub-limits (e.g., $1,000 per unscheduled item).

## Requirements for Coverage
### Scheduling Items
All items to be covered under this PAF policy must be individually scheduled on the Declarations Page with a specific description and a stated value.

### Appraisals
For items valued at $5,000 or more (e.g., jewelry, fine art, unique collectibles), a current professional appraisal (dated within the last 36 months) is required at the time of policy inception or when adding new items. For items between $1,000 and $4,999, a detailed sales receipt from within the last 12 months may be accepted in lieu of an appraisal.

### Proof of Ownership
The Insured must be able to provide proof of ownership for all scheduled items upon request, typically in the form of a bill of sale, receipt, or other verifiable documentation.

### Prompt Reporting
Any acquisition of new valuable articles intended for coverage must be reported to the Company within 30 days of acquisition. Coverage for new acquisitions is conditional upon satisfactory appraisal (if required) and endorsement to the policy.

## Claim Procedures
### Reporting a Loss
In the event of a covered loss, the Insured must:
1.  Notify the Company as soon as reasonably possible, ideally within 48 hours of discovery.
2.  For theft or mysterious disappearance, immediately notify the police and obtain a formal police report.
3.  Take all reasonable steps to protect the covered property from further damage.
4.  Provide a detailed written statement of loss, including a description of the item(s), date of loss, and circumstances.

### Required Documentation for Claims
*   Completed Claim Form (provided by Company).
*   Police Report (for theft or mysterious disappearance).
*   Original appraisal or sales receipt for the lost or damaged item.
*   Photographs of the damaged item (if applicable).
*   Repair estimates from qualified professional(s) (if seeking repair).
*   Any other documents reasonably requested by the Company to assess the claim.

### Settlement Process
Upon receipt of all required documentation, the Company will:
1.  Review the claim details and policy terms.
2.  Assign a claims adjuster to investigate the loss.
3.  For damaged items, determine if repair or replacement is appropriate based on the extent of damage and cost.
4.  For total losses or items covered on an "Agreed Value" basis, pay the lesser of the scheduled amount or the agreed value.
5.  For other total losses, pay the lesser of the actual cash value, cost to repair/replace, or scheduled amount, less any applicable depreciation for non-agreed value items.
6.  Settlements will typically be issued within 30 days of agreement on the claim amount.

## Exceptions and Special Conditions
*   **Pair & Set Clause:** If a covered loss to an item that is part of a pair or set occurs, the Company may pay the value of the particular item lost or damaged, or pay the difference between the value of the pair or set before the loss and its value after the loss. The Insured is not obligated to surrender the remaining item(s) to the Company.
*   **Breakage of Fragile Articles:** Breakage of articles such as glassware, marble, porcelain, statuary, and other articles of a brittle or fragile nature is typically covered only if caused by fire, lightning, aircraft, vehicles, theft, attempted theft, vandalism, malicious mischief, or collision.
*   **Fine Arts in Transit:** Fine art coverage may be subject to specific packing and shipping requirements if being transported by a third-party carrier. Failure to adhere to these requirements may void transit coverage.
*   **Period of Exhibition/Loan:** If scheduled fine art is loaned or exhibited elsewhere, the Company must be notified in advance and may require specific security measures or temporary adjustments to the policy terms.

## Policy Changes and Cancellations
*   **Adding or Removing Items:** The Insured must notify the Company in writing to add or remove scheduled items. An endorsement to the policy will be issued, and premium adjustments will be made accordingly.
*   **Cancellation:** The Insured may cancel this policy at any time by providing written notice to the Company. The Company may cancel this policy by providing 30 days' written notice to the Insured (or 10 days for non-payment of premium). Premiums will be calculated on a pro-rata basis for partial policy periods in event of cancellation.
