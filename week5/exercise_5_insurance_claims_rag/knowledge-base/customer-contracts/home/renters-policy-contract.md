# Renters Insurance Policy Contract

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This Renters Insurance Policy Contract ("Policy") details the agreement between the named Insured(s) and [Insurance Company Name] ("the Company") regarding coverage for the Insured's personal property and liability risks relevant to their rented dwelling. Its purpose is to provide financial protection against defined perils, subject to the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions outlined herein.

## 6. General Conditions Applicable to all Coverages

### 6.1 Your Duties After Loss

In case of a loss to which this insurance may apply, you must:
1.  Give prompt notice to us or our agent. Include a description of the property involved and the time and cause of loss.
2.  Notify the police in case of loss by theft.
3.  Notify the credit card or fund transfer card company if the loss involves a credit card or fund transfer card.
4.  Protect the property from further damage. If repairs are required, make reasonable and necessary repairs to protect the property, and keep an accurate record of repair expenses.
5.  Cooperate with us in the investigation or settlement of the claim.
6.  Permit us to inspect the property and records proving the loss.
7.  As often as we reasonably require:
    *   Show us the damaged property.
    *   Provide us with records and documents we request and permit us to make copies.
    *   Submit to examinations under oath and sign the same.
8.  Send to us, within 60 days after our request, your signed, sworn proof of loss which sets forth to the best of your knowledge and belief:
    *   The time and cause of loss.
    *   The interest of the "insured" and all others in the property involved.
    *   All encumbrances on the property.
    *   Other insurance which may cover the loss.
    *   Changes in title or occupancy of the property during the policy period.
    *   Specifications of any damaged building and detailed estimates for repair.
    *   An inventory of damaged personal property showing quantity, description, actual cash value, and amount of loss.
    *   Receipts for additional living expenses incurred.

### 6.2 Settlement of Loss

*   **Personal Property:** We will settle losses under Coverage A at Actual Cash Value (ACV) at the time of loss, but not exceeding the amount necessary to repair or replace the property. We may elect to pay the value of the property, repair or replace the property, or take all or part of the property at an agreed or appraised value.
*   **Replacement Cost Endorsement (if purchased):** If the Replacement Cost Personal Property endorsement is attached to your policy, we will pay the cost to repair or replace the property, without deduction for depreciation, subject to the following:
    1.  The property must be repaired or replaced.
    2.  The loss must exceed the deductible.
    3.  We will not pay more than the cost to repair or replace at our discretion, or the limit of liability shown in the Declarations Page.
    4.  You may make a claim for ACV and then make a claim for the additional amount necessary to repair or replace the property within 180 days after the date of loss.

### 6.3 Appraisal

If you and we fail to agree on the amount of loss, either may demand an appraisal of the loss. In this event, each party will select a competent appraiser and notify the other of the appraiser's identity within 20 days of receiving the written demand. The appraisers will then select a competent and impartial umpire. If the appraisers are unable to agree upon an umpire within 15 days, you or we can ask a judge of a court of record in the state where the Insured Location is located to make the selection. The appraisers will then separately set the amount of loss. If the appraisers submit a written report of an agreement to us, the amount agreed upon will be the amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will be the amount of loss. Each party will pay its chosen appraiser and bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally.

### 6.4 Concealment or Fraud

This Policy is void if, whether before or after a loss, an "insured" has intentionally concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance, made false statements, or engaged in fraudulent conduct relating to this insurance.
