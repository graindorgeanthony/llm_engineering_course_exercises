# HO6 Condo Insurance Policy Contract

## 1. Overview

This document constitutes the full HO6 Condominium Unitowners Insurance Policy Contract (referred to as "the Policy" or "this Policy"). It outlines the agreement between the named insured(s) and XYZ Insurance Company (referred to as "the Company") regarding coverage for property, liability, and additional living expenses for a condominium unit. The Policy aims to protect unit owners against specified perils and liabilities arising from their ownership and occupancy of a condominium unit.

## 2. Scope of Coverage

This Policy provides coverage for the Insured's personal property, the interior building items of the condominium unit not covered by the condominium association's master policy, loss of use, and personal liability.

### 2.1 Covered Property

*   **A. Coverage A - Dwelling:** Covers the alterations, appliances, fixtures, and improvements which are a part of the building within the insured's condominium unit, and which are not covered by the condominium association's master policy. This includes items such as:
    *   Interior walls and partitions
    *   Built-in cabinets and countertops
    *   Flooring (e.g., hardwood, tile, carpet)
    *   Bathroom and kitchen fixtures (e.g., sinks, tubs, toilets, dishwashers, ovens)
    *   Permanently installed lighting fixtures
    *   Window treatments that are "part of the building"
    *   Owned property located in an area adjacent to the residence premises and used by the insured exclusively under the association's purview (e.g., a dedicated storage locker).

    *   Personal property of a guest or residence employee while on the part of the residence premises occupied by an insured.
    *   Property while in transit or temporarily located at another residence.
*   **C. Other Structures:** This Policy typically does *not* provide explicit "Coverage B - Other Structures" as found in standard HO3 policies, given the nature of condominium ownership. Any structures owned by the insured and not part of the main condominium building, but located on areas adjacent to the residence premises and used exclusively by the insured (e.g., a privately owned storage shed if explicitly permitted and not covered by the association), will generally fall under the Dwelling or Personal Property definitions where applicable, and specific endorsement may be required.

*   Property separately described and insured in whole or in part by other insurance.
*   Animals, birds, or fish.

### 2.3 Coverage D - Loss Of Use

### 2.4 Coverage E - Personal Liability
