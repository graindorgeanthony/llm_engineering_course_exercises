## 6. Conditions

### 6.1. Duties of the Insured After a Loss
In case of a loss to covered property, the Insured must:
1.  Give prompt notice to the Company or its agent.
2.  Protect the property from further damage.
3.  Prepare an inventory of damaged personal property, showing the quantity, description, actual cash value, and loss amount. Attach all bills, receipts, and related documents.
4.  As often as the Company reasonably requires:
    *   Show the damaged property.
    *   Provide records and documents we request and permit us to make copies.
    *   Submit to examinations under oath and sign the same.
5.  Cooperate with the Company in investigation of any claim.
6.  Send to the Company, within 60 days after our request, a signed, sworn statement of loss.

### 6.2. Mortgagee Clause
If a mortgagee is named in the Declarations Page, any loss payable under Coverage A or B will be paid to the mortgagee and the Insured, as their interests appear. The Company will provide the mortgagee with 10 days' notice of cancellation of the policy or non-renewal of the policy.

### 6.3. Cancellation and Non-renewal
*   The Insured may cancel at any time by written notice.
*   The Company may cancel the policy for reasons stated in the policy provisions (e.g., non-payment of premium, material misrepresentation) by providing written notice as required by law (e.g., 10 days for non-payment, 30 days for other reasons).

### 6.4. Appraisal
If the Insured and Company fail to agree on the amount of loss, either party may demand an appraisal. Each party will select a competent appraiser. The appraisers will then select an umpire. If they fail to agree on an umpire, one will be selected by a judge of a court having jurisdiction. The appraisers will state separately the actual cash value and amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will set the amount of loss.

## 7. Extensions and Endorsements

This policy includes standard extensions, and additional endorsements may be added as agreed upon by the Insured and the Company, and reflected on the Declarations Page.
*   **Examples of Common Endorsements:**
    *   Water Backup and Sump Overflow
    *   Matching of Undamaged Exterior Siding and Roofing
    *   Identity Fraud Expense
    *   Scheduled Personal Property (for high-value items like jewelry, fine art)
    *   Home Business endorsement

## 8. Claims Procedures

### 8.1. Initiating a Claim
1.  **Notification:** Contact [Insurance Company Name] Claims Department at [Phone Number] or submit a claim online via [Website URL] as soon as practically possible after a loss.
2.  **Information Required:** Policy number, date and time of loss, description of the incident, address of loss, available contact information.

### 8.2. Claim Investigation and Adjustment
1.  A claims adjuster will be assigned to investigate the loss, assess damages, and determine coverage applicability.
2.  The Insured must provide all requested documentation, photographs, repair estimates, and receipts.
3.  The adjuster will review the Policy terms, limits, and deductibles while evaluating the claim.

### 8.3. Decision Logic for Claim Approval
*   A claim will be approved if:
    *   The loss event is a covered peril under the specific coverage section (e.g., fire for dwelling, theft for personal property).
    *   The property involved is covered property under the policy.
    *   The loss exceeds the applicable deductible.
    *   The Insured has fulfilled their duties after a loss as outlined in 6.1.
    *   No exclusions apply to the loss event.
*   Claims may be partially approved if certain aspects of the loss are covered while others are not, or if payment is limited by special limits of liability or depreciation (ACV).

### 8.4. Payment of Claim
*   Once the claim is approved and the amount of loss is agreed upon, payment will be issued to the Insured, and if applicable, to the mortgagee or additional interest, subject to the policy limits and deductibles.
*   For RCV claims on dwelling, an initial payment for ACV may be issued, with the depreciation holdback paid upon completion of repairs and submission of invoices.
