This Policy provides a guaranteed death benefit to the designated Beneficiary(ies) upon the death of the Insured, along with a cash value component that accumulates over time on a tax-deferred basis. It is designed to offer lifelong coverage with fixed premiums.

## 2. Scope

This Policy covers the life of the individual named as the Insured on the Policy Declarations page. It specifies the terms, conditions, benefits, and obligations of both the Policyholder and the Company regarding the Whole Life insurance coverage.

## 4. Main Content

### 4.1 Death Benefit

Upon receipt of satisfactory proof of the Insured's death while this Policy is in force, We will pay the Death Benefit, less any outstanding loans and accrued interest, to the designated Beneficiary(ies). The Death Benefit amount is specified in the Policy Declarations.

### 4.2 Cash Value Accumulation

This Policy accumulates Cash Value on a guaranteed basis. The Cash Value grows over time at a stated minimum interest rate, as specified in the Policy Specifications. This accumulation is tax-deferred under current tax laws. The Cash Value may be used for policy loans or surrendered for its Surrender Value.

### 4.3 Premiums

The Policyholder agrees to pay regular premiums as set forth in the Policy Declarations. Premiums are due on the due date specified. A grace period of thirty-one (31) days is allowed for the payment of each premium after the first. If the premium is not paid within the grace period, and the Policy has insufficient Cash Value to fund an Automatic Premium Loan (if selected), the Policy will lapse.

### 4.4 Policy Loans

The Policyholder may borrow against the Cash Value of this Policy, provided the Policy is in force and has accumulated sufficient Cash Value.
*   **Maximum Loan Amount:** The maximum amount that can be borrowed is generally 90% of the Policy's Cash Value, less any existing indebtedness.
*   **Interest Rate:** Policy loans accrue interest at a fixed or adjustable rate as specified in the Policy Specifications. Current interest rate for new loans is 5% annual simple interest.
*   **Repayment:** Loan repayment is flexible. Unpaid interest will be added to the loan principal annually. Outstanding loans and interest will reduce the Death Benefit payable to Beneficiary(ies) and the Surrender Value if the Policy is terminated.
*   **Impact of Loan on Cash Value:** While a loan is outstanding, the portion of Cash Value securing the loan may earn a reduced or no interest rate.

### 4.5 Non-Forfeiture Options

If premium payments cease after Cash Value has accumulated, the Policyholder may elect one of the following non-forfeiture options within sixty (60) days of the premium due date:

*   **Option A: Cash Surrender Value:** Receive the Net Surrender Value of the Policy. This terminates the Policy.
*   **Option B: Reduced Paid-Up Insurance:** The Net Surrender Value is used as a single premium to purchase a new, smaller amount of Whole Life insurance that is fully paid-up. No further premiums are required, and the Cash Value continues to grow.
*   **Option C: Extended Term Insurance:** The Net Surrender Value is used as a single premium to purchase a Term Life insurance policy for the same Death Benefit amount as the original Policy, for a specified period. No further premiums are required. This option does not accumulate Cash Value.

If no option is selected, Option C (Extended Term Insurance) will automatically be applied after the grace period expires, provided there is sufficient Cash Value.

### 4.6 Riders and Endorsements

Any riders or endorsements attached to this Policy and listed in the Policy Declarations are an integral part of this Contract and supersede any conflicting provisions contained within the main body of the Policy. Examples include:
*   Waiver of Premium Rider

This clause applies only if death occurs within two (2) years of the Issue Date of the Policy or within two (2) years of the effective date of an increase in coverage for the increased amount.

## 8. Examples

### 8.1 Reduced Paid-Up Illustration

A Policy with a $100,000 Death Benefit and $15,000 Cash Value lapses. The Policyholder elects Reduced Paid-Up insurance. Assuming the Net Surrender Value of $15,000 is sufficient to purchase $40,000 of paid-up Whole Life insurance based on the Insured's age, the Policy will convert to a $40,000 paid-up policy. No further premiums are due, and the $40,000 will be paid at death.

### 8.2 Policy Loan Scenario

Policyholder has a $20,000 Cash Value and needs $5,000 for an emergency. They request a policy loan. The Company approves the loan at a 5% annual interest rate. The Death Benefit remains $100,000. If the Insured dies with the $5,000 loan outstanding and $250 in accrued interest, the Beneficiary will receive $100,000 - $5,000 - $250 = $94,750.

## 9. Decision Logic

### 9.1 Premium Payment Status

*   **Payment received on or before due date:** Policy remains In Force.
*   **Payment received within 31-day grace period:** Policy remains In Force. Late payment fee may apply.
*   **Payment not received within 31-day grace period, with sufficient Cash Value and Auto Premium Loan elected:** Automatic Premium Loan is processed, Policy remains In Force, loan balance increases. Policyholder notified of loan.
*   **Payment not received within 31-day grace period, insufficient Cash Value or Auto Premium Loan not elected:** Policy Lapses. Non-forfeiture options triggered.

### 9.2 Death Benefit Payout Criteria
