# Premium Payment Terms and Billing Cycles

## Overview
This document outlines the standard terms and conditions governing the payment of policy premiums, including accepted payment methods, billing cycles, grace periods, and the consequences of non-payment. These terms are integral to maintaining active policy coverage.

## Scope
This policy applies to all individual and group insurance policies issued by HorizonSure Inc. and its subsidiaries, covering all premium types (e.g., life, health, property, casualty). It encompasses initial premium payments, renewal premiums, and premium adjustments. This document does not cover reinsurance premium terms, which are stipulated in separate reinsurance agreements.

## Definitions
*   **Premium:** The amount payable by the policyholder to HorizonSure Inc. for insurance coverage.
*   **Billing Cycle:** The recurring period during which premium payments are due (e.g., monthly, quarterly, annually).
*   **Due Date:** The specific date on which a premium payment is expected to be received by HorizonSure Inc.
*   **Grace Period:** A limited period after the premium due date during which a policy remains in force despite non-payment, allowing the policyholder to make the payment without lapse.
*   **Lapse:** The termination of an insurance policy due to the policyholder's failure to pay premiums.
*   **Reinstatement:** The restoration of a lapsed policy to active status, often requiring payment of overdue premiums and fulfillment of other conditions.
*   **Policy Effective Date:** The date from which insurance coverage officially begins.

## Payment Terms

### Payment Due Dates
All premiums are due on the date specified in the Policy Schedule. For initial premiums, payment is required before the Policy Effective Date unless otherwise stated in the policy contract. Subsequent renewal premiums are due at the start of each billing cycle.

### Accepted Payment Methods
Policyholders may remit payments using the following methods:
*   **Automated Clearing House (ACH) / Direct Debit:** Electronic transfers directly from a bank account. Requires proper authorization via a signed form or online portal.
*   **Credit/Debit Card:** Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover. Payments can be made online, via phone, or recurring automated payments.
*   **Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT):** Bank-to-bank transfers for larger corporate clients.
*   **Check/Money Order:** Payable to "HorizonSure Inc." and mailed to P.O. Box 1234, Anytown, USA 98765. Please include policy number on all physical payments.
*   **Online Payment Portal:** Secure portal available at `www.horizonsure.com/pay` for one-time or recurring payments.

### Billing Cycles
Policyholders can select from the following standard billing cycles at policy inception, subject to product availability and minimum premium requirements:
*   **Annual:** Full premium collected once per year.
*   **Semi-Annual:** Premium collected twice per year (every six months).
*   **Quarterly:** Premium collected four times per year (every three months).
*   **Monthly:** Premium collected twelve times per year.
*   **Bi-Weekly:** (Available for some group policies) Premium collected every two weeks.

Changes to billing cycles may incur administrative fees and require a written request to be submitted at least 30 days prior to the next billing cycle start date.

## Grace Period

### Standard Grace Period
A grace period of **31 calendar days** from the premium due date is provided for the payment of any premium due. During the grace period, the policy remains in full force and effect. If the premium is paid within the grace period, coverage continues without interruption.

### Effect of Death/Claim During Grace Period
If a claim occurs, or in the case of a life insurance policy, if the insured dies during the grace period and before the overdue premium is paid, the amount of any overdue premium will be deducted from the claim benefit paid.

## Policy Cancellation Due to Non-Payment

### Notice of Non-Payment and Intent to Cancel
If a premium payment is not received by the end of the grace period, HorizonSure Inc. will issue a "Notice of Cancellation" to the policyholder at their last known address. This notice will be sent via standard mail and, if an email address is on file, via email. The notice will specify:
*   The amount of overdue premium.
*   The final date by which payment must be received to prevent cancellation (generally 10-15 days from the notice date, depending on state regulations).
*   The exact date and time the policy will lapse if payment is not received.

### Lapse of Policy
If the overdue premium is not received by the date specified in the Notice of Cancellation, the policy will automatically lapse. Coverage will cease as of 12:01 AM local time on the cancellation date. HorizonSure Inc. will have no further liability for claims arising after the lapse date.

### Pro-rata Premium Calculation
For policies that are cancelled mid-term (e.g., due to non-payment after initial payment), premiums are typically calculated on a pro-rata basis for the period coverage was active. Any unearned premium will be refunded to the policyholder within 30 days of cancellation. However, if a claim was paid during a grace period and the policy subsequently lapses, the pro-rata calculation will factor in the claim amount.

## Policy Reinstatement

### Eligibility for Reinstatement
A lapsed policy may be eligible for reinstatement within **three (3) years** from the date of lapse, subject to the following conditions:
1.  Submission of a written application for reinstatement by the policyholder.
2.  Payment of all overdue premiums with interest (currently at 8% per annum, compounded annually).
3.  Submission of satisfactory evidence of insurability (e.g., medical examination, health questionnaire) as required by HorizonSure Inc. underwriting guidelines. This is primarily for life and health policies.
4.  No material change in risk since the lapse date.

### Reinstatement Approval Process
Upon receipt of the reinstatement application and required payments:
1.  **Underwriting Review (if applicable):** For life and health policies, new underwriting review will be performed based on submitted evidence of insurability.
2.  **Payment Verification:** Confirmation of all overdue premiums and interest.
3.  **Approval/Denial:** HorizonSure Inc. will notify the policyholder of the decision within 15 business days of receiving all required documentation.
    *   **Approval:** Policy will be reinstated, and a reinstatement certificate or updated policy schedule will be issued, confirming the new effective date of reinstatement.
    *   **Denial:** If denied, all premiums paid for reinstatement will be refunded. Reasons for denial will be provided in writing.

### Effective Date of Reinstatement
The reinstated policy will generally become effective upon approval of the application and receipt of all required premiums and satisfactory evidence of insurability, typically not before the date such requirements are met. There will be no coverage for the period between the lapse date and the reinstatement effective date.

## Exceptions
*   **State-Specific Regulations:** Grace periods, notice requirements, and reinstatement terms may vary based on specific state insurance regulations. Where state law requires a longer grace period or different notice, state law will supersede this document.
*   **Endorsements:** Specific policy endorsements or riders may alter these general payment terms. These will be explicitly stated within the policy contract.
*   **Premium Holidays:** Certain group policies may offer premium holidays under specific conditions; these will be detailed in the group master contract.
