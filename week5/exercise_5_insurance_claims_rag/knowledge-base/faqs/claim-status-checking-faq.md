## Common Questions & Answers

### Q1: What information do I need to check my claim status?
**A1:** You will always need your **Claim Number**. Having your Policy Number readily available is also highly recommended. If contacting a live agent, be prepared to verify your identity with your full name, date of birth, and policy address.

### Q2: How long does it take for my claim status to update after I submit documents?
**A2:** Updates in the online portal typically appear within 24-48 business hours after documents are received and logged into our system. If you mail physical documents, please allow an additional 3-5 business days for mail delivery and processing.

### Q3: My claim status is "Under Review." What does that mean?
**A3:** "Under Review" indicates that your claim has been received and is being evaluated by our claims team. An adjuster has likely been assigned and is beginning the investigation process. This stage often involves verifying policy coverage, analyzing the details of the loss, and reviewing initial documentation.

### Q4: My claim status is "Awaiting Documentation." What should I do?
**A4:** This means your Claims Adjuster requires additional information or documents to proceed with the claim assessment.
*   **Action:** Log into your Online Policyholder Portal. The "Claims" section will typically list the specific documents that are outstanding.
*   **Contact:** If you are unsure what is needed or have difficulty obtaining it, please contact your assigned Claims Adjuster directly (their contact information is available in the portal and on any recent correspondence) or call our claims inquiry line.

### Q5: How often should I check my claim status?
**A5:** We recommend checking approximately every 2-3 business days, especially if you are actively submitting documentation or awaiting an update. For major milestones or decisions, we will typically notify you via email, text message (if opted in), or postal mail.

### Q6: I received a notification that my claim has been "Closed." What does this mean?
**A6:** A "Closed" status typically means that a final decision has been made on your claim. This could indicate:
*   The claim has been paid in full.
*   A settlement has been reached.
*   The claim was denied.
*   The claim was withdrawn by the policyholder.
Details regarding the closure (e.g., payment amount, denial reason) will be communicated to you via official correspondence and will be available in the "Claims" section of your Online Policyholder Portal.

### Q7: Can I check the status of a claim that was filed a long time ago?
**A7:** Yes, you can typically access information about past claims through your Online Policyholder Portal for up to 7 years after the claim closure date. If you need information on an older claim, please contact a Claims Agent.

### Q8: What if I don't have my Claim Number?
**A8:** If you cannot locate your Claim Number:
*   Check any recent correspondence from StellarProtect Insurance (emails, letters).
*   Log into your Online Policyholder Portal; current and recent past claims are usually listed there.
*   Call our claims inquiry line (1-800-555-2524) and provide your Policy Number. An agent will be able to retrieve your Claim Number after verifying your identity.

## Timelines
While individual claim processing times vary greatly depending on complexity, claim type, and required investigations, here are some general timelines:
*   **Initial Status Update (Claim Filed to Under Review):** Typically within 1-2 business days of claim submission.
*   **Document Review:** 2-5 business days from receipt of required documents by the Claims Adjuster.
*   **Payment Processing:** Once a claim decision is made and approved, payments are typically issued within 3-7 business days, depending on the payment method (e.g., direct deposit vs. check by mail).

## Exceptions
*   **Complex Claims:** Claims involving severe injuries, extensive property damage, multi-party liability, or legal disputes may take significantly longer than standard timelines due to detailed investigations, expert evaluations, and negotiations.
*   **Catastrophe Events:** During widespread natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires), claims processing times may be extended due to a high volume of claims. StellarProtect Insurance prioritizes these claims and will provide public updates on expected timelines during such events.
*   **Fraud Investigations:** If a claim is flagged for potential fraud, processing will be paused until the investigation is complete, which can extend timelines substantially.
