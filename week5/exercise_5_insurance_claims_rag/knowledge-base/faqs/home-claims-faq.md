### **3. What happens after I file a claim?**

**Procedure:**
1.  **Claim Assignment:** A claims adjuster will be assigned to your case within 24-48 business hours. You will receive an email or call with their contact information.
2.  **Initial Contact & Investigation:** The adjuster will contact you to discuss the loss, explain the claims process, and often schedule an appointment to inspect the damaged property.
3.  **Damage Assessment:** The adjuster will inspect the damage, take photos, and potentially collect statements. They will assess the cause of loss, determine policy coverage, and estimate repair costs.
4.  **Repair Estimates:** You may need to obtain repair estimates from qualified contractors. The adjuster may also provide estimates or work with preferred vendors.
5.  **Settlement Offer:** Based on the investigation, the adjuster will provide a settlement offer, outlining the covered damages, repair costs, and applicable deductible.
6.  **Payment:** Once you agree to the settlement, payment will be issued according to your policy terms. This may be directly to you, your contractor, or jointly.

### **4. How long does it take to process a claim?**

**Timelines:**
The processing time for a home insurance claim can vary significantly depending on the complexity of the damage, the need for further investigation, and external factors like severe weather events leading to a high volume of claims.
*   **Initial Contact:** You should receive contact from an adjuster within 1-2 business days of reporting the claim.
*   **Inspection & Estimate:** Damage inspection and initial estimate generation typically occur within 5-10 business days after adjuster assignment, schedules permitting.
*   **Settlement:** For straightforward claims, a settlement offer can be made within 10-15 business days following the inspection. More complex claims, requiring multiple inspections, specialized reports (e.g., engineering reports), or extensive documentation (e.g., contents inventories), can take 30-90 days, or even longer in severe catastrophic events.
*   **Payment:** Payments are typically disbursed within 5 business days after a signed release or agreement on the settlement.

We strive to process all claims as efficiently as possible while ensuring a thorough investigation.

### **5. What is a deductible and how does it apply to my claim?**

**Requirements/Criteria:**
*   **Definition:** Your deductible is the amount you are responsible for paying out-of-pocket toward a covered loss before your insurance coverage begins.
*   **Application:** If your policy has a \$1,000 deductible, and your approved damage repairs total \$5,000, Horizon Insurance will pay \$4,000, and you will be responsible for the initial \$1,000.
*   **Per Occurrence:** The deductible generally applies "per occurrence," meaning for each separate claim incident.
*   **Types:** Deductibles can be a fixed dollar amount (e.g., \$1,000) or a percentage of your home's dwelling coverage (e.g., 1% or 2% for wind/hail claims in certain regions). Your specific deductible amounts are listed on your policy's Declaration Page.

### **6. Am I covered for emergency repairs?**

**Coverage Specifications:**
Yes, your policy generally requires you to take reasonable steps to prevent further damage. This often includes emergency repairs.
*   **Specifics:** Coverage is provided for *reasonable and necessary* costs incurred to protect your property from subsequent damage after a covered loss (e.g., boarding up broken windows, placing a tarp over a damaged roof, temporary shoring).
*   **Documentation:** You must keep all receipts for materials and labor for these emergency repairs. These costs will be considered part of your total claim and factored into your settlement, subject to your policy limits and deductible.
*   **Approval:** For large or non-urgent emergency repairs, it is always recommended to contact your adjuster for guidance and potential pre-approval before proceeding to ensure reimbursement.

### **7. Will my premiums increase if I file a claim?**

**Decision Logic:**
Filing a claim *can* impact your premium, but this is not guaranteed for every claim. Factors that influence premium increases include:
*   **Claim Frequency:** Multiple claims within a short period (e.g., 3 claims in 5 years) are more likely to result in a premium increase.
*   **Claim Severity:** Larger claims (e.g., over \$10,000) may have a greater impact than very small claims.
*   **Claim Type:** "Act of God" claims (e.g., weather-related) might be treated differently than claims for which you are deemed partially at fault (e.g., negligence leading to water damage).
*   **State Regulations:** Insurance regulations vary by state, affecting how claims impact premiums.
*   **Claims History:** Your overall claims history with Horizon Insurance and previous insurers is considered during renewal.
Horizon Insurance evaluates policies on a case-by-case basis at renewal time. A single minor claim may not necessarily lead to an increase, but a pattern of claims will likely result in higher premiums or even non-renewal.

### **8. What if I disagree with the adjuster's estimate?**

**Procedures/Exceptions:**
If you disagree with the adjuster's assessment or repair estimate:
1.  **Communicate:** Clearly communicate your concerns to your assigned adjuster, explaining why you believe the estimate is insufficient (e.g., missing items, incorrect materials, underestimated labor).
2.  **Provide Documentation:** Submit any additional evidence you have, such as itemized contractor estimates that detail different scope or costs, photos, or receipts for items you believe were undervalued.
3.  **Second Opinion:** You are encouraged to obtain independent repair estimates from reputable, licensed contractors. Share these with your adjuster.
4.  **Re-evaluation:** The adjuster will review your documentation and contractor estimates and may conduct a re-inspection. They may negotiate with your contractor directly to reach an agreed scope of work and price.
5.  **Appraisal Clause:** If an agreement still cannot be reached, your policy may contain an "Appraisal Clause." This allows both you and Horizon Insurance to hire an independent appraiser. The two appraisers then select an umpire, and a decision by any two of the three parties is binding. This process is usually initiated as a last resort before legal action.

### **9. What is the difference between Actual Cash Value (ACV) and Replacement Cost Value (RCV)?**

**Definitions/Coverage Specifications:**
*   **Actual Cash Value (ACV):** This pays for the depreciated value of your damaged or stolen property. It’s the cost to replace the item new, minus a deduction for wear, tear, and age. For example, a 10-year-old roof would be paid out at its current market value, not the cost of a brand-new roof.
*   **Replacement Cost Value (RCV):** This pays for the cost to replace your damaged or stolen property with a new item of similar kind and quality without any deduction for depreciation, up to your policy limits. Most homeowner's policies are written with RCV for dwelling damage.

**How it works in claims:**
Pertaining to personal property (contents), many policies initially pay out claims based on ACV. Once the damaged item is actually replaced and proof of purchase is submitted (receipts), the depreciation holdback is paid out, converting the claim to RCV. Dwelling (structure) coverage is typically paid out on an RCV basis, with depreciation sometimes held back until repairs are completed, especially for larger losses.

### **10. What if my home is uninhabitable after a covered loss?**

**Coverage Specifications/Procedures:**
If a covered loss makes your home uninhabitable, your policy's "Additional Living Expenses" (ALE) or "Loss of Use" coverage can help.
*   **Coverage:** ALE covers reasonable and necessary increases in living expenses incurred while your home is being repaired or rebuilt. This includes costs like hotel stays, temporary rental housing, extra mileage for commuting, increased food expenses (e.g., eating out), and pet boarding.
*   **Activation:** This coverage activates when authorities declare your home uninhabitable, or if your adjuster determines the damage prevents you from safely staying in your home.
*   **Documentation:** Keep detailed records and all receipts for these increased expenses. Your adjuster will review these costs for reimbursement, typically up to a specified limit and duration outlined in your policy declaration page.
*   **Contact Adjuster:** Notify your adjuster immediately if your home is uninhabitable. They will guide you on appropriate temporary housing options and track your eligible expenses.

### **11. What if I find additional damage after the adjuster's initial inspection?**

**Procedures/Exceptions:**
It is common for additional damage to be discovered during the repair process, especially hidden damage.
*   **Notify Immediately:** Contact your assigned adjuster as soon as new damage is discovered. Do not proceed with repairs to the newly discovered damage without informing them.
*   **Documentation:** Take photos or videos of the additional damage. If a contractor discovered it, ask them to document it and provide a revised estimate detailing the findings.
*   **Re-inspection:** The adjuster may need to conduct a re-inspection to verify the additional damage and adjust the claim scope and settlement amount accordingly. Timely notification ensures these additions can be integrated into your existing claim without delay.

### **12. What is subrogation?**

**Definitions/Decision Logic:**
Subrogation is the process where Horizon Insurance, after paying your claim, seeks to recover the amount of the loss from a third party who may have been responsible for the damage.
*   **Example:** If your neighbor's tree falls onto your roof, and your policy pays for the roof repair, Horizon Insurance may then "subrogate" against your neighbor's liability insurance to recoup the funds paid for your claim.
*   **Policyholder Impact:** This process does not directly affect your claim payment. If successful, subrogation can sometimes lead to a refund of your deductible, especially if the responsible third party is identified and pays for the damages. You are expected to cooperate with Horizon Insurance in any subrogation efforts.
