# Appraisal Process FAQs

## Overview/Purpose
This document provides answers to frequently asked questions regarding the appraisal process for property and vehicle damage claims. The appraisal process is a formal dispute resolution mechanism available to policyholders when there is a disagreement with the insurer regarding the amount of loss for a covered claim. Its purpose is to facilitate a fair and equitable settlement based on expert evaluation.

## Scope
These FAQs apply to all personal and commercial lines property and vehicle damage claims filed with [Your Company Name] where the policy includes an appraisal clause. This process is initiated *after* liability for the loss has been acknowledged but the amount of damage is in dispute. It does not cover disputes regarding policy coverage, deductibles, or policy interpretation.

## Definitions

*   **Appraisal Clause:** A provision in an insurance policy that outlines the process for resolving disagreements between the insurer and the policyholder regarding the amount of loss.
*   **Appraiser:** An independent, qualified individual chosen by either the policyholder or the insurer to estimate the amount of loss. Appraisers must be disinterested parties.
*   **Umpire:** An independent, neutral third party selected by the two appraisers (or by a court if they cannot agree) to resolve any differences in their assessment of the loss. The umpire's decision, when combined with one appraiser's assessment, becomes binding.
*   **Actual Cash Value (ACV):** The cost to replace damaged property with new property of like kind and quality, minus depreciation.
*   **Replacement Cost Value (RCV):** The cost to replace damaged property with new property of like kind and quality without deduction for depreciation.
*   **Notice of Intent to Appraise:** A formal written communication from either the policyholder or the insurer indicating the desire to invoke the appraisal clause.

## Main Content

### 1. What is the appraisal process?
The appraisal process is a contractual right under your insurance policy designed to resolve disputes over the amount of loss. If you and [Your Company Name] cannot agree on the amount of damage to your property or vehicle, either party can invoke the appraisal clause. Each party selects an independent appraiser. The two appraisers then attempt to agree on the amount of loss. If they cannot agree, they submit their differences to a neutral umpire. A decision agreed upon by any two of the three (your appraiser, our appraiser, or the umpire) is binding on both parties.

### 2. When can I request an appraisal?
You can request an appraisal once [Your Company Name] has accepted liability for the loss but there is a disagreement on the cost to repair or replace the damaged property. This typically occurs after you have received our initial estimate, and you believe it is insufficient, or when your contractor's estimate differs significantly from ours. Most policies require that appraisal be requested within a certain timeframe (e.g., 60 days) after the disagreement arises, so it's important to review your specific policy language.

### 3. How do I start the appraisal process?
To initiate appraisal, you must send a formal written "Notice of Intent to Appraise" to [Your Company Name]'s claims department. This notice should clearly state your desire to invoke the appraisal clause and name your chosen appraiser, including their contact information and qualifications. [Your Company Name] will then respond by naming its own appraiser within a specified timeframe (typically 15-30 days).

### 4. Who pays for the appraisal?
Typically, each party (you and [Your Company Name]) pays the fees of their chosen appraiser. The fees for the umpire and other appraisal expenses (such as the cost of a meeting location, if necessary) are usually split equally between both parties. Some policies may have specific language regarding fee allocation, so always refer to your policy.

### 5. What qualifications should my appraiser have?
Your appraiser should be an experienced, independent professional with expertise in estimating property or vehicle damage for the type of loss you incurred. They should not have a financial interest in the outcome of your claim beyond their appraisal fee. Common choices include experienced contractors, public adjusters, or auto body repair experts. They cannot be a relative or business partner.

### 6. What happens if the two appraisers disagree?
If the two appraisers cannot agree on the entire amount of loss, they will identify the specific items or aspects of the loss where they differ. They then submit these disputed items to the umpire for a decision. The umpire will review the evidence presented by both appraisers and render a decision on the disputed items.

### 7. What is the role of the umpire?
The umpire acts as a neutral tie-breaker. Their role is to review the different estimates and arguments presented by both appraisers and make a final, binding decision on the disputed aspects of the loss. The umpire does not conduct a new independent investigation but relies on the information provided by the appraisers.

### 8. Is the appraisal decision binding?
Yes, the decision agreed upon by any two of the three parties (your appraiser, our appraiser, and the umpire) is final and binding on both you and [Your Company Name] regarding the amount of loss. This means you generally cannot appeal the appraisal award in court, though there are very limited grounds for challenging an appraisal award (e.g., fraud, lack of jurisdiction).

### 9. How long does the appraisal process take?
The duration of the appraisal process can vary depending on the complexity of the claim, the availability of appraisers and the umpire, and the responsiveness of all parties. On average, the process can take anywhere from 30 to 90 days from the date both appraisers are named until a binding award is issued.

### 10. Does appraisal affect my ability to sue the insurance company?
Invoking appraisal typically resolves only the dispute over the amount of loss. It does not waive your right to pursue legal action for other issues, such as a dispute over coverage or bad faith. However, once an appraisal award is rendered and paid, the vast majority of financial disputes related to the physical damage are typically concluded.

## Requirements/Criteria

*   **Policy Clause:** The policy must contain an appraisal clause.
*   **Coverage Accepted:** Liability for the loss must be acknowledged by [Your Company Name].
*   **Dispute on Amount:** There must be a genuine disagreement solely on the amount of loss, not on coverage or liability.
*   **Written Notice:** Policyholder must provide formally written "Notice of Intent to Appraise" within specified policy timelines.
*   **Appraiser Qualifications:** Appraisers selected by both parties must be independent and qualified experts.

## Exceptions
*   **Coverage Disputes:** The appraisal process cannot be used to determine if a loss is covered under the policy. Questions of coverage must be resolved separately.
*   **Liability Disputes:** If there's a disagreement on whether [Your Company Name] is liable for the damage, appraisal is not applicable.
*   **Fraud/Misrepresentation:** If evidence of fraud or material misrepresentation is discovered, [Your Company Name] may decline to participate in or withdraw from the appraisal process.

## Examples

**Example 1: Vehicle Damage**
*   **Scenario:** Your car sustains front-end damage. [Your Company Name]'s adjuster estimates repairs at $7,500. Your preferred auto body shop provides an estimate of $9,800, citing additional structural damage and higher parts costs.
*   **Appraisal Action:** You invoke appraisal. You appoint an independent auto damage appraiser. [Your Company Name] appoints their appraiser. If they cannot agree, an umpire is brought in. A final binding amount of $8,900 is agreed upon, covering necessary repairs.

**Example 2: Property Damage (Roof)**
*   **Scenario:** Your roof is damaged in a hail storm. [Your Company Name]'s estimate for repair (patching) is $4,000. Your roofing contractor states the entire roof needs replacement due to widespread damage and provides an estimate of $15,000.
*   **Appraisal Action:** You send a Notice of Intent to Appraise. Both parties appoint property appraisers. The appraisers assess the extent of damage and condition of the roof. They agree to replace half the roof at a cost of $9,500 after the umpire confirms the extent of storm damage impacts.

## Decision Logic
The decision to invoke appraisal rests with either the policyholder or [Your Company Name] when the specific criteria under "Requirements/Criteria" are met. The final award amount is determined by the appraiser's consensus or, failing that, by the umpire's decision when combined with one of the appraisers' assessments.

## Evidence/Documentation
To support the appraisal process, policyholders should provide:
*   Detailed repair estimates from qualified contractors/shops.
*   Photos or videos of the damage.
*   Any relevant invoices for emergency repairs.
*   Specifications or documentation of damaged property (e.g., age, model, materials).
*   Any reports from independent inspections or engineers.

## Timelines
*   **Notice of Intent:** Within policy-specified timeframe (e.g., 60 days) from dispute.
*   **Appraiser Selection (Both Parties):** Typically 15-30 days from receipt of Notice of Intent.
*   **Umpire Selection:** Within 15 days of appraisers' failure to agree, or court-appointed if necessary.
*   **Appraisal Award:** Generally within 30-90 days from when both appraisers are named.
*   **Payment of Award:** Typically within 30 days of receiving the signed appraisal award.
