# What To Do After an Accident: Frequently Asked Questions for Policyholders

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide through frequently asked questions (FAQs) for policyholders on the essential steps to take immediately following an auto accident or a home incident. Following these guidelines helps ensure your safety, proper documentation, and a smoother claims process.

## Scope

This FAQ applies to all policyholders of AutoGuard Insurance experiencing an auto accident (collision, single-vehicle incident, vandalism, theft) or a home incident (fire, water damage, theft, natural disaster damage) requiring a potential claim filing. It covers immediate actions, information gathering, and initial contact with AutoGuard Insurance.

## Definitions

*   **Policyholder:** The individual or entity named in the insurance policy as the insured.
*   **Incident:** Any event, auto-related or home-related, that results in damage, injury, or loss covered by an AutoGuard Insurance policy.
*   **First Notice of Loss (FNOL):** The initial report made by a policyholder (or third party) to the insurer detailing an incident that may lead to a claim.
*   **Claim Adjuster:** An AutoGuard Insurance representative assigned to investigate a claim, determine coverage, and negotiate settlements.
*   **Evidence:** Any form of proof, such as photos, videos, police reports, or witness statements, relevant to an incident.

## General Steps After Any Incident

### Q1: What is the absolute first step I should take after any accident or incident?

A1: Your safety and the safety of others is the top priority.
1.  **Ensure Safety:** Move yourself and any injured parties to a safe location if possible. If in an auto accident, pull over to the side of the road, away from traffic. If a home incident, evacuate the premises if there's an ongoing danger (e.g., fire, gas leak, structural instability).
2.  **Assess Injuries:** Check yourself and others for injuries. Call emergency services (911 in the U.S. and Canada) immediately if anyone is injured or if there's a significant threat (e.g., fire, severe structural damage).
3.  **Do Not Admit Fault:** Even if you think you might be at fault, avoid making any statements that admit responsibility at the scene of an auto accident. Stick to the facts.

### Q2: Is it always necessary to call the police?

A2: Not always, but it is highly recommended for most incidents:
*   **Auto Accidents:** Call the police if there are injuries, significant damage (estimate over $1,500), hit-and-run, or if the other party is uncooperative or seems impaired. A police report can be crucial for your claim.
*   **Home Incidents:** Call the police for theft, vandalism, or any suspicious activity related to the incident immediately. For events like fires or major water damage, call the fire department to ensure safety and mitigate further damage.

## Auto Accident Specific Questions

### Q3: What information should I collect at the scene of an auto accident?

A3: Collect as much detail as possible, focusing on objective information:
*   **Other Driver's Information:**
    *   Full Name
    *   Phone Number
    *   Driver's License Number and State
    *   Insurance Company Name and Policy Number
    *   Vehicle Make, Model, Year, Color
    *   Vehicle License Plate Number
*   **Witness Information (if any):**
    *   Full Name
    *   Phone Number
    *   Email Address
*   **Accident Details:**
    *   Date and Time of Accident
    *   Exact Location (street names, cross street, landmarks)
    *   Diagram of the accident scene (sketch)
    *   Description of weather conditions

    *   Officer's Name and Badge Number
    *   Police Report Number (if available at the scene, otherwise request later)

### Q4: What kind of photos or videos should I take after an auto accident?

A4: Document the scene thoroughly:
*   **Vehicle Damage:** Take photos of all damage to your vehicle, the other vehicle(s), and any property damage involved.
*   **Overall Scene:** Capture wide shots of the accident scene showing vehicle positions, traffic signals/signs, and road conditions.
*   **License Plates:** Clear photos of all vehicle license plates involved.
*   **Injuries:** If safe and appropriate, photos of any visible injuries.
*   **Debris:** Any debris on the road resulting from the accident.
*   **Skid Marks:** Photos of any skid marks.

### Q5: When should I contact AutoGuard Insurance to report an auto accident?

A5: Report the accident to AutoGuard Insurance as soon as it is safe to do so, ideally within 24 hours of the incident. Prompt reporting helps expedite the claims process. You can report through:
*   **Phone:** Call our 24/7 claims hotline at 1-800-AUTOGUARD (1-800-288-6482).
*   **Online Portal:** Log into your policyholder account on our website.
*   **Mobile App:** Use the AutoGuard Insurance mobile app for claims submission.

**Decision Logic:** If injuries prevent immediate reporting, report as soon as medically able. Delaying reporting can complicate claim investigation.

## Home Incident Specific Questions

### Q6: What immediate steps should I take after a home incident, like a fire or water leak?

A6:
1.  **Ensure Safety:** Evacuate if there's immediate danger (e.g., active fire, gas leak, severe structural damage).
2.  **Emergency Services:** Call 911 for fires, serious injuries, or if there's a risk of structural collapse. For smaller incidents like a burst pipe, shut off the main water supply to your home. For electrical issues, shut off the main power.
3.  **Prevent Further Damage:** Once safe, take reasonable steps to prevent further damage. For example, if a pipe bursts, turn off the water. If a window is broken, cover it with plywood or plastic sheeting. Keep receipts for any emergency repairs or supplies.
4.  **Do Not Dispose of Damaged Items:** Do not throw away damaged items before an adjuster has had a chance to inspect them, unless they pose a health or safety hazard.

### Q7: What kind of documentation do I need for a home incident claim?

A7: Gather as much evidence as possible:
*   **Photos/Videos:** Document the damage extensively from multiple angles, both close-up and wide shots of affected areas. Include photos of damaged items before they are moved or disposed of.
*   **Police/Fire Reports:** Obtain a copy of any reports filed by emergency services (police, fire department).
*   **Inventory of Damaged/Lost Items:** Create a detailed list including:
    *   Description of item (brand, model, serial number)
    *   Date of purchase
    *   Original cost
    *   Estimated replacement cost
    *   Receipts or appraisals (if available)
*   **Receipts:** Keep all receipts for temporary repairs, emergency housing, or other incident-related expenses.

### Q8: When should I contact AutoGuard Insurance to report a home incident?

A8: Report the incident to AutoGuard Insurance as soon as you have ensured safety and taken initial mitigation steps, ideally within 48 hours. Prompt reporting allows us to dispatch an adjuster and initiate the claims process efficiently. You can report through the same channels as auto claims:
*   **Phone:** Call our 24/7 claims hotline at 1-800-AUTOGUARD (1-800-288-6482).

*   **Mobile App:** Use the AutoGuard Insurance mobile app for claims submission.

## Common Questions for All Claims

### Q9: What happens after I report my claim to AutoGuard Insurance?

A9:
1.  **First Notice of Loss (FNOL):** We will record the details of your incident.
2.  **Claim Number:** You will receive a unique claim number for your incident. Keep this number handy for all future correspondence.
3.  **Claim Adjuster Assignment:** A claim adjuster will be assigned to your case and will contact you typically within 24-48 business hours to discuss the next steps, request additional information, and schedule an inspection if necessary.
4.  **Investigation:** The adjuster will investigate the claim, review policy coverage, and assess damages.
5.  **Resolution:** Based on the investigation and policy terms, the adjuster will work towards a resolution, which may include repair payments, replacement costs, or other covered benefits.

### Q10: Should I get repair estimates before contacting AutoGuard Insurance?

A10: For non-emergency repairs, it is generally recommended to wait until you have spoken with your assigned claim adjuster. They will guide you on the process for obtaining estimates, and in many cases, we may have preferred repair networks or will arrange for appraisers. If you must make emergency repairs to prevent further damage, keep all receipts and document the damage thoroughly with photos before and after the repair.

### Q11: What if my policy involves a deductible?

A11: Most property and auto policies include a deductible, which is the amount you are responsible for paying out-of-pocket before your insurance coverage begins to pay. Your adjuster will explain your specific deductible amount and how it applies to your claim during the claims process.

### Q12: What if I need assistance with temporary housing after a home incident?

A12: If your home becomes uninhabitable due to a covered loss, your AutoGuard home insurance policy may provide coverage for Additional Living Expenses (ALE). Contact your claim adjuster immediately to discuss your specific policy's ALE benefits, limits, and how to arrange for temporary housing and submit related expenses. Keep all receipts for temporary lodging, food, and other increased living costs.
