# Assigned Risk Plans FAQs

## Overview/Purpose
This document provides answers to frequently asked questions regarding Assigned Risk Plans (ARPs), also known as residual market plans. These plans are designed to ensure that individuals and businesses who are unable to obtain insurance through the voluntary market due to their high-risk profile can still secure necessary coverage. This FAQ aims to clarify common questions about their function, eligibility, and implications for policyholders and claims.

## Scope
This FAQ covers general information applicable to most state-mandated Assigned Risk Plans across various lines of business, including auto and property insurance. It addresses questions about policy placement, premium setting, claims processing, and policyholder responsibilities. It does not provide legal advice regarding specific state statutes or individual policy terms, which may vary.

## Definitions
*   **Assigned Risk Plan (ARP):** A program or facility, mandated by state law, that makes insurance available to individuals and businesses unable to obtain coverage in the voluntary (standard) market.
*   **Residual Market:** The aggregation of all state-mandated mechanisms (like ARPs) designed to serve consumers who cannot find coverage in the "standard" or "voluntary" insurance market.
*   **Voluntary Market:** The standard insurance market where applicants can freely choose an insurer based on competitive rates and offerings.
*   **High-Risk Driver/Applicant:** An individual or entity deemed by standard insurers to present a higher-than-average risk of loss, often due to poor driving records, specific property characteristics, or claims history.
*   **Servicing Carrier:** A standard insurance company appointed by the ARP to issue policies and handle claims on behalf of the plan. They administer the policy as if it were voluntarily written.
*   **Assessment:** A charge levied against all insurers operating in a state to fund the losses of the ARP.

## Main Content: Frequently Asked Questions

### What is an Assigned Risk Plan (ARP)?
An Assigned Risk Plan is a facility created by state law to provide insurance coverage for individuals and businesses who are considered "high-risk" and are unable to obtain coverage in the voluntary insurance market. These plans ensure that no one is left without essential coverage, such as auto liability or property insurance, simply because they present an elevated risk profile.

### Who is eligible for an Assigned Risk Plan?
Eligibility criteria vary by state and the specific type of insurance (e.g., auto, property, workers' compensation). Generally, eligibility is limited to applicants who have been declined coverage by a specified number of voluntary market insurers (e.g., 2-3 rejections) or who cannot find coverage at all. Applicants must typically be residents of the state or operate a business there, meet basic licensing requirements (for auto), and possess valid insurable interest.
*   **Auto Insurance:** Often for drivers with multiple accidents, DUIs, extensive violations, or a history of non-payment.
*   **Property Insurance:** For properties in high-risk zones (e.g., coastal areas prone to hurricanes, areas with high wildfire risk) or with severe loss history.

### How do I apply for an ARP policy?
Applications for ARPs are typically submitted through a licensed insurance agent or broker. The agent will complete the necessary forms, attest to the applicant's inability to secure coverage in the voluntary market, and submit the application to the state's ARP or managing organization.

### Which insurance company will my policy be with?
While you apply through the ARP, your policy will be issued and administered by a "servicing carrier." These are standard insurance companies that are obligated by state law to accept a certain share of assigned risks. The ARP assigns your policy to one of these carriers on a rotating basis. The servicing carrier handles all policy issuance, billing, and claims processing.

### Are premiums higher in Assigned Risk Plans?
Yes, premiums for ARP policies are generally higher than those in the voluntary market. This is because ARP policyholders represent a higher risk pool. Premiums are set by state insurance departments or rate bureaus affiliated with the ARP and are designed to cover the expected higher losses and administrative costs. While higher, these premiums are regulated and designed to be adequate, not excessive.

### What kind of coverage is available through an ARP?
ARPs typically offer the minimum required liability coverages as mandated by state law (e.g., bodily injury and property damage liability for auto, basic dwelling and personal property for property). Some plans may offer expanded coverages (e.g., collision, comprehensive for auto; additional perils for property) at an additional cost, but these are often more limited than what's available in the voluntary market.

### How does the claims process work for an ARP policy?
The claims process for an ARP policy is handled directly by the assigned servicing carrier. You would report a claim to the servicing carrier using their standard claims reporting procedures (e.g., phone, online portal) just as you would with a voluntary market policy. The servicing carrier's adjusters will investigate the claim, determine coverage, and process payment according to the policy terms and conditions. The fact that it's an ARP policy usually does not change the claims handling process from the policyholder's perspective.

### Can an ARP policy be non-renewed or canceled?
Yes, an ARP policy can be non-renewed or canceled, though the reasons are often more limited than in the voluntary market. Common reasons for non-renewal or cancellation include:
*   **Non-payment of premium:** Failure to pay required premiums on time.
*   **Material misrepresentation:** Providing false or misleading information on the application.
*   **Fraud:** Deliberate deception to obtain coverage or benefits.
*   **Change in risk:** Significant increase in risk making the insured uninsurable even under ARP standards.
*   **No longer eligible for the ARP:** If the policyholder's risk profile improves to the point where they are eligible for the voluntary market.

### How long do I have to stay in an Assigned Risk Plan?
There is no fixed duration. The goal of ARPs is to be a temporary solution. Policyholders are encouraged to improve their risk profile (e.g., maintain a clean driving record, address property hazards) and periodically seek coverage in the voluntary market. Once voluntary market insurers are willing to offer coverage, the policyholder can transition out of the ARP. Servicing carriers typically review policyholder eligibility for the voluntary market at renewal.

### What happens if I file a claim on my ARP policy?
Filing a claim on an ARP policy is similar to filing a claim on a voluntary market policy. The claim will be handled by your servicing carrier. However, multiple claims, especially at-fault claims for auto or significant property losses, can further solidify your high-risk status. This may make it even more difficult to transition back to the voluntary market and could contribute to higher renewal premiums within the ARP.

### Are there any specific requirements for claims documentation under an ARP?
Generally, the documentation requirements for claims under an ARP policy are the same as for voluntary market policies. This includes:
*   Police reports (for vehicle accidents, theft, vandalism)
*   Medical records (for bodily injury claims)
*   Damage estimates or repair invoices
*   Proof of ownership or covered property
*   Any relevant correspondence or records related to the incident.
The servicing carrier's claims adjuster will guide you through the specific documentation needed for your particular claim.

### Can my ARP policy be transferred to a different servicing carrier?
Typically, once a policy is assigned to a servicing carrier, it remains with that carrier for the policy term. At renewal, the ARP might reassign policies based on its rotation system, or the original servicing carrier might renew it directly. Direct transfer upon policyholder request before renewal is rare unless specific, compelling circumstances exist.

## Exceptions
*   **State-Specific Regulations:** All details regarding ARPs (eligibility, coverage, premium calculation, appeals processes) are subject to specific state insurance laws and regulations. This FAQ provides general guidance, but local laws supersede.
*   **Specialty Risks:** Some highly specialized or extremely high risks may not be accommodated even by ARPs and might require surplus lines or other unique market solutions.

## Examples
*   **Auto Example:** John has three speeding tickets and one at-fault accident within the last three years. Multiple standard insurers decline his auto insurance application. His agent helps him apply to the state's Assigned Risk Auto Plan. The plan assigns his policy to "ABC Insurance Company" as the servicing carrier. John pays higher premiums but secures the state-mandated minimum liability coverage. When he has a minor fender-bender, he reports it directly to ABC Insurance Company, who handles the claim according to his policy terms.
*   **Property Example:** A homeowner owns a beach-front property in a hurricane-prone state. After several wind-related claims, no standard insurer is willing to offer windstorm coverage. The homeowner's agent applies to the state's residual market property plan (e.g., a "Fair Access to Insurance Requirements" plan or FAIR Plan). The plan issues a policy via "XYZ Property Insurers" with a specific wind-deductible clause and higher premiums. When a storm causes damage, XYZ Property Insurers manage the assessment and payment of the claim.

## Decision Logic
*   **Placement in ARP:** Decision is based on documented rejections from voluntary market insurers and meeting state-specific ARP eligibility criteria. Often requires a minimum of 2-3 rejections.
*   **Claim Payout:** Decision is made by the servicing carrier based on policy terms, applicable state laws, and the findings of their claims investigation.
*   **Transition out of ARP:** Decision for voluntary market eligibility rests with individual standard insurers, often contingent on a clean claims history and improved risk profile over a period (e.g., 3-5 years without major incidents).

## Evidence/Documentation
Applicants for ARPs generally need to provide:
*   Proof of prior rejections from voluntary market insurers (e.g., written letters, agent attestations).
*   Complete and accurate application forms.
*   Driving records (for auto insurance).
*   Property inspection reports (for property insurance).
*   Proof of identity and residency/business registration.

## Timelines
*   **Application Processing:** Varies by state, but typically 5-15 business days for initial assignment after a complete application is submitted.
*   **Policy Issuance:** Once assigned to a servicing carrier, policies are typically issued within 7-10 business days.
*   **Claim Processing:** Standard claims handling timelines apply; state regulations often mandate "prompt" investigation and payment of covered claims, typically within 15-30 days of receiving all necessary documentation.
