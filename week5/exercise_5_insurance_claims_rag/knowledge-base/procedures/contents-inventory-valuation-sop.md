This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the process for assisting policyholders in creating comprehensive home contents inventories and conducting accurate valuations of personal property following a covered loss event. The purpose is to streamline the claims process, ensure fair and consistent settlement, and provide clear guidance to claims adjusters and contents specialists. Adherence to this SOP minimizes disputes, reduces processing times, and enhances policyholder satisfaction.

## 4. Initial Process for Contents Inventory

### 4.1. Policyholder Notification and Guidance

Upon notification of a claim involving potential contents loss, the assigned claims adjuster will:

1.  **Acknowledge Claim & Explain Process:** Contact the policyholder within 24 hours of assignment to acknowledge the claim and provide a high-level overview of the contents inventory and valuation process.
2.  **Provide Inventory Packet:** Electronically send or mail the "Contents Inventory Packet" (PF-001) which includes:
    *   Detailed instructions for completing the inventory form.
    *   Examples of properly documented items.
    *   Information on required proof of ownership/value.
    *   Guidance on separating damaged vs. undamaged items.
    *   A list of common pitfalls to avoid (e.g., vague descriptions).
3.  **Explain Depreciation & ACV/RCV:** Clearly explain the difference between ACV and RCV, and how depreciation will be applied based on policy terms. Advise policyholder to list current replacement costs where possible.
4.  **Offer Assistance Options:** Inform the policyholder of available assistance, including:
    *   **Self-Inventory:** Policyholder completes the inventory using the provided forms and instructions.
    *   **Adjuster Assistance:** For complex or extensive losses, the claims adjuster may schedule time to walk through the property with the policyholder to assist in identifying items.
    *   **Contents Specialist Referral:** For large, complex, or emotionally taxing losses, offer to engage a professional contents inventory service (vendor list in Section 8).

### 4.2. Minimum Information Required per Item

For every item submitted on the inventory, the policyholder must attempt to provide the following details:

*   **Item Description:** Specific and detailed (e.g., "Sony Bravia 55-inch LED Smart TV" instead of "TV").
*   **Location:** Room where the item was located.
*   **Date of Purchase (Approximate):** Month and year if exact date is unknown.
*   **Original Purchase Price (Approximate):** If available.
*   **Condition Prior to Loss:** (e.g., "excellent," "good," "fair," "worn").
*   **Estimated Replacement Cost:** Current cost to replace with a new, like-kind-and-quality item.
*   **Proof of Ownership/Value:** Indicate if a receipt, photo, or other documentation is available.

## 5. Contents Valuation Process

### 5.1. Valuation Methods

Claims adjusters and contents specialists will primarily utilize the following methods for valuation:

1.  **Policyholder Documentation:** Receipts, credit card statements, appraisals, and warranties are the primary source of original cost and value.
2.  **Market Research:** For items without direct proof of purchase, adjusters will research current market prices for like-kind-and-quality items using:
    *   Online retailers (Amazon, Best Buy,等の主要なECサイト)
    *   Specialty retailers (for electronics, collectibles, furniture)
    *   Salvage/restoration specialists (for unique items)
    *   Contents valuation software (e.g., Xactimate Contents, CoreLogic Contents Express)
3.  **Expert Appraisal:** For high-value items (e.g., jewelry, art, antiques) exceeding predefined thresholds (e.g., $5,000 per item) or items lacking clear market comparables, an independent appraiser will be engaged.
4.  **Vendor Services:** Approved contents inventory and valuation vendors can be engaged for comprehensive lists and valuations, particularly for large or complex losses.

### 5.2. Depreciation Application

Depreciation will be applied consistently based on policy terms and actuarial guidelines.

*   **Standard Depreciation Table:** Utilize the company's approved depreciation schedule for various item categories (e.g., appliances, electronics, furniture, clothing).
*   **Factors for Depreciation:** Age, condition prior to loss, expected useful life, and obsolescence are key factors.
*   **ACV Payment:** Initial payment will typically be based on ACV.
*   **RCV Payment:** If the policy includes RCV coverage, the difference between ACV and RCV will be paid upon proof of replacement of the item(s) by the policyholder. Policyholders must provide receipts for replaced items to receive the RCV differential.

## 6. Procedures for Review and Approval

### 6.1. Adjuster Review of Policyholder Inventory

1.  **Initial Scan:** Upon receipt, perform an initial scan of the policyholder's inventory for completeness and clarity.
2.  **Missing Information:** If critical information is missing for multiple items, contact the policyholder to request additional details or clarification.
3.  **Validation of High-Value Items:** For items exceeding a $1,000 estimated replacement cost, prioritize validation of their existence and value through available proof (photos, receipts) or independent research.
4.  **Discrepancy Identification:** Identify discrepancies between estimated values, age, and available market comparables.
5.  **Calculate ACV:** Use market research and the depreciation schedule to calculate the Actual Cash Value for each item.

### 6.2. Contents Specialist Involvement (Optional/Required)

*   **Referral Criteria:** A contents specialist referral is **required** for losses with an estimated contents value exceeding $25,000, or at the adjuster's discretion for complex cases, or when the policyholder needs significant assistance.
*   **Specialist Role:** The specialist will conduct the inventory, perform detailed valuations, and provide a comprehensive report including RCV, ACV, and supporting documentation.
*   **Adjuster Oversight:** The adjuster retains ultimate oversight and approval of the specialist’s report.

### 6.3. Approval Process

1.  **Adjuster Recommendation:** The claims adjuster prepares a contents valuation summary, outlining the total ACV and potential RCV payments based on the reviewed inventory.
2.  **Claims Manager Approval:** For contents claims exceeding a total ACV of $50,000 or any individual item valuation exceeding $10,000, claims manager approval is required before payment authorization.
3.  **Payment Authorization:** Once approved, the adjuster will process the ACV payment to the policyholder.
4.  **RCV Holdback & Documentation:** Communicate clearly the RCV holdback amount and the requirement for policyholders to submit proof of replacement for RCV payment.

## 7. Exceptions and Special Considerations

*   **Scheduled Personal Property:** High-value items explicitly scheduled on the policy (e.g., jewelry, fine art) are handled according to their specific appraised value and policy limits, typically without depreciation. These items require independent appraisal for valuation.
*   **Undocumented Items:** For items with no proof of purchase or clear market value, adjusters should attempt to obtain comparative quotes or use reasonable estimates based on similar items owned by the policyholder, escalating to a claims manager if a fair value cannot be determined.
*   **Restoration vs. Replacement:** For items that can be cleaned, repaired, or restored to pre-loss condition at a cost less than replacement, restoration should be pursued. Contents specialists or restoration vendors will provide estimates.
*   **Sentimental Value:** Acknowledge sentimental value but advise policyholders that policy provisions cover financial loss, not sentimental value.
*   **Fraud Indicators:** Any suspected fraudulent activity (e.g., padding lists, claiming items not owned, providing fabricated receipts) must be immediately escalated to the SIU (Special Investigations Unit) for review.

## 8. Approved Contents Inventory and Valuation Vendors

The following vendors are approved for contents inventory, pack-out, cleaning, and valuation services:

*   **Vendor A:** Contact: [Vendor A Phone], Email: [Vendor A Email]
*   **Vendor B:** Contact: [Vendor B Phone], Email: [Vendor B Email]
*   **Vendor C:** Contact: [Vendor C Phone], Email: [Vendor C Email]

Adjusters should consult the "Vendor Selection Guide" for specific criteria and routing protocols based on claim size and location.

## 9. Evidence and Documentation Requirements
