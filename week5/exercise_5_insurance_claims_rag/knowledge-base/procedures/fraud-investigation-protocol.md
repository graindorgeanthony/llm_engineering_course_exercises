# Protocol: Claims Fraud Investigation

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This document outlines the standard operating procedures (SOP) for identifying, investigating, and reporting suspected fraudulent insurance claims. The purpose of this protocol is to ensure a consistent, thorough, and legally compliant approach to fraud investigation, protect company assets, maintain financial integrity, and deter fraudulent activities. Adherence to this protocol helps safeguard policyholders' interests and ensures fair and accurate claim processing.

## 2. Scope

This protocol applies to all employees involved in the claims handling process, including claims adjusters, claims supervisors, legal teams, and the Special Investigations Unit (SIU). It covers all types of insurance claims processed by [Company Name], including but not limited to auto, property, casualty, and health claims.

### 2.1. In-Scope:
*   Initial identification of fraud indicators.
*   Referral process to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU).
*   Investigation procedures conducted by SIU.
*   Evidence collection and documentation.
*   Legal considerations and compliance.
*   Reporting and communication protocols.
*   Post-investigation actions and claim disposition.

### 2.2. Out-of-Scope:
*   General claims processing (unless fraud indicators are present).
*   Underwriting fraud investigations (these are covered by *Underwriting Fraud Guidelines v2.1*).
*   Internal employee fraud investigations (these are covered by *Internal Compliance Policy v3.0*).

## 3. Definitions

*   **Claimant:** The individual or entity filing a claim for benefits or services.
*   **Fraud Indicator:** Any circumstance, pattern, or information that suggests the possibility of a fraudulent claim.
*   **Fraudulent Claim:** A claim made with the intent to deceive the insurer for financial gain, involving misrepresentation of material facts, deception, or false statements.
*   **Special Investigations Unit (SIU):** A dedicated team responsible for investigating suspected fraudulent claims.
*   **Material Misrepresentation:** A false statement of a material fact used to induce a party to enter into a contract or to accept a claim. A "material" fact is one that would influence a reasonable person's decision.
*   **Subrogation:** The right for an insurer to pursue a third party that caused an insurance loss to the insured.

## 4. Main Content: Fraud Investigation Process

The claims fraud investigation process consists of four main phases: Identification, Referral, Investigation, and Resolution.

### 4.1. Phase 1: Identification of Fraud Indicators

Claims handlers are responsible for identifying potential fraud indicators during initial review and processing.

#### 4.1.1. Common Fraud Indicators:
*   **Documentation Discrepancies:** Altered documents (invoices, medical records), missing documentation vital to the claim, inconsistencies in multiple documents.
*   **Inconsistent Statements:** Contradictory statements from the claimant, witnesses, or reported facts.
*   **Suspicious Circumstances:**
    *   Claim filed immediately after policy inception.
    *   Unusual or overly descriptive narratives.
    *   Property claims filed just before or after policy cancellation/lapse.
    *   Medical claims for injuries inconsistent with the reported incident.
    *   High-value claims with minimal verifiable loss.
    *   Claimant unusually knowledgeable about insurance procedures and legal terminology.
    *   Claimant resisting common investigative procedures (e.g., examination under oath, independent medical exam).
    *   Unusual or previous claim history (e.g., multiple similar claims, claims with different insurers for similar incidents).
*   **Behavioral Indicators:** Evasiveness, refusal to cooperate, unusual urgency for settlement, aggressive or threatening behavior.
*   **Vendor/Provider Suspicions:** Consistent use of specific, questionable vendors or medical providers; inflated invoices; unproven services.
*   **Prior Loss History:** Claimant has a history of frequent or repetitive claims, especially those with similar circumstances or injuries.

### 4.2. Phase 2: Referral to Special Investigations Unit (SIU)

Once fraud indicators are identified, the claim handler must refer the claim to the SIU.

#### 4.2.1. Referral Criteria:
Any claim exhibiting one or more significant fraud indicators, or a combination of minor indicators suggesting a pattern, **must** be referred to the SIU. Claims handlers should err on the side of referral if suspicion exists.

#### 4.2.2. Referral Procedure:
1.  **Document Findings:** The claims handler must compile all identified fraud indicators, suspicious facts, and relevant claim documents in the claims management system (CMS).
2.  **Complete SIU Referral Form:** Fill out the "SIU Claim Referral Form (FORM-SIU-001)" within the CMS, providing a detailed narrative of the suspicions and supporting evidence.
3.  **Notify Supervisor:** Inform the immediate supervisor of the referral. The supervisor will review the referral for completeness and appropriateness within 24 business hours.
4.  **Submit Referral:** Once approved by the supervisor, the referral is formally submitted to the SIU via the CMS. The status of the claim in CMS should be updated to "Referred to SIU."
5.  **Cease Investigation:** Upon referral, the claims handler must cease active investigation of the claim, except for immediate actions required to secure evidence or prevent further loss (e.g., securing a damaged vehicle). All subsequent investigative steps will be managed by SIU.

### 4.3. Phase 3: SIU Investigation Process

The SIU conducts in-depth investigations following a systematic approach.

#### 4.3.1. Initial SIU Review (within 48 hours of referral):
*   SIU Intake Specialist reviews the referral form and supporting documentation.
*   Assesses the credibility of fraud indicators.
*   Determines if further investigation is warranted or if the claim can be returned to claims staff as "No SIU Action Required."

#### 4.3.2. Investigation Planning:
*   If investigation is warranted, an SIU investigator is assigned.
*   The investigator develops an investigation plan, including objectives, investigative techniques, required resources, and a timeline.

#### 4.3.3. Investigative Techniques (may include, but are not limited to):
*   **Interviewing:** Conducting recorded or unrecorded interviews with the claimant, witnesses, and involved parties (e.g., medical providers, repair shops). Adherence to state-specific regulations for interviews (e.g., notice of rights) is mandatory.
*   **Document Analysis:** Forensic examination of submitted documents; sourcing original documents from third parties; comparing signatures, dates, and content.
*   **Public Records Search:** Utilizing databases to check claimant's criminal history, litigation history, financial status, business affiliations, and address history.
*   **Social Media Analysis:** Reviewing publicly available social media profiles for inconsistencies with claim details (e.g., claimant alleging total disability while posting active lifestyle photos). This must be conducted in compliance with internal social media guidelines and privacy laws.
*   **Surveillance:** Physical surveillance (when justified and legally permissible) to observe claimant's activities, conducted by licensed private investigators. Requires prior management approval and justification.
*   **Expert Consultation:** Engaging medical, forensic, engineering, or other experts as needed (e.g., accident reconstruction, fire cause and origin, IME).
*   **Scene Examination:** Physical inspection of incident sites, damaged property, or vehicles, often in collaboration with experts.
*   **Data Analytics:** Utilizing internal and external data to identify patterns, networks, and anomalies suggestive of fraud.

#### 4.3.4. Evidence Collection and Documentation:
*   All evidence gathered must be meticulously documented, dated, and stored securely in the SIU case file within the CMS.
*   Maintain a strict chain of custody for physical evidence.
*   Photographs, videos, audio recordings, and digital evidence must be timestamped and verifiable.
*   Witness statements and interview notes must be accurate and signed/attested where possible.

#### 4.3.5. Legal Considerations and Compliance:
*   **State Regulations:** All investigations must comply with state-specific insurance anti-fraud acts, fair claims practices regulations, and privacy laws (e.g., HIPAA for health claims).
*   **Privacy:** Handle claimant information with the utmost respect for privacy rights.
*   **Bad Faith Avoidance:** Investigations must be conducted objectively, fairly, and without prejudice. Avoid actions that could be construed as harassment or bad faith. Investigations must have a legitimate basis.
*   **Examination Under Oath (EUO):** If necessary, an EUO may be scheduled. This requires adherence to policy provisions and state-specific notice requirements.

## 5. Requirements and Criteria for Fraud Determination

A claim is determined to be fraudulent when:
*   There is clear and convincing evidence of a material misrepresentation or omission.
*   The misrepresentation or omission was made knowingly and intentionally by the claimant or an involved party.
*   The intent was to deceive [Company Name] and obtain undeserved benefits.
*   The misrepresentation or omission is directly related to the claim's validity, amount, or entitlement.

## 6. Decision Logic: Post-Investigation Actions

Based on the SIU investigation, one of the following determinations will be made:

### 6.1. Fraud Substantiated:
*   **Decision:** Evidence conclusively proves the claim is fraudulent.
*   **Action:**
    1.  **Deny Claim:** Issue a formal denial letter to the claimant, clearly stating the reasons for denial, referencing relevant policy language and investigative findings.
    2.  **Refer to Law Enforcement/State Fraud Bureau:** Mandatory referral to the appropriate state insurance fraud bureau and, if applicable, local law enforcement agencies, in accordance with state statutory requirements and company policy. This referral is made by the SIU Manager or designated officer.
    3.  **Recovery Efforts:** If benefits were already paid, initiate recovery actions (e.g., subrogation, civil suit).
    4.  **Internal Reporting:** Document full investigation findings and outcomes in the CMS for statistical analysis and future reference.

### 6.2. Fraud Suspected, Insufficient Evidence for Denial/Referral:
*   **Decision:** Strong indicators of fraud, but not enough conclusive evidence to meet the burden of proof for denial or law enforcement referral.
*   **Action:**
    1.  **Deny Specific Portions:** Deny only those portions of the claim for which there is valid, non-fraudulent basis for denial (e.g., not covered, proof of loss not met).
    2.  **Continue Monitoring:** Flag the claimant's file for future claims monitoring.
    3.  **Document:** Thoroughly document all suspicions and investigative efforts in the CMS.
    4.  **Educate/Train:** Identify any systemic issues or new fraud trends for training adjusters.

### 6.3. No Fraud Found (Claim Return to Adjuster):
*   **Decision:** Investigation found no evidence of fraud, or suspicions were unsubstantiated.
*   **Action:**
    1.  **Return to Claims Handler:** The claim is returned to the original claims handler for standard processing.
    2.  **Document:** SIU provides a summary of investigative findings to the claims handler and documents the resolution in the CMS.
    3.  **Expunge Fraud Flags:** Remove any fraud-related flags or hold codes from the claim, allowing normal processing.

## 7. Examples

### 7.1. Example 1: Property Fire Claim with Substantiated Fraud
*   **Claim Type:** Homeowners insurance - building total loss due to fire.
*   **Indicators:** Policy purchased 2 weeks prior to loss; claimant recently experienced financial difficulties and business failure; property showed signs of highly accelerated burn patterns inconsistent with accidental ignition; forensic reports indicate accelerants used.
*   **Investigation:** SIU conducted origin and cause investigation, financial background check, and witness interviews. Expert report confirmed arson. Claimant's statements were inconsistent with evidence and timeline.
*   **Outcome:** Claim denied. Referred to State Fire Marshal and District Attorney's office for criminal investigation.

### 7.2. Example 2: Auto Accident Claim with Suspected Fraud, Insufficient Evidence
*   **Claim Type:** Auto insurance - bodily injury claim from a low-speed rear-end collision.
*   **Indicators:** Claimant reported extensive injuries (whiplash, back pain) inconsistent with minor vehicle damage; delays in seeking medical treatment; existing prior medical history of similar injuries not initially disclosed; car occupied by 4 individuals who all filed injury claims.
*   **Investigation:** SIU arranged for an Independent Medical Examination (IME) that concluded injuries were pre-existing or exaggerated. Surveillance showed claimant engaging in activities inconsistent with reported disability. However, no direct proof of intentional staging or definitive medical fraud via altered documents was found.
*   **Outcome:** Claim adjusted to reflect actual non-fraudulent damages/injuries, but the exaggerated portions were denied. Claimant's file flagged for enhanced scrutiny on future claims. No law enforcement referral due to insufficient conclusive evidence of criminal intent.

## 8. Evidence and Documentation Requirements

*   **SIU Case File:** A complete and detailed SIU case file must be maintained for every referred claim, whether fraud is substantiated or not.
*   **Contents:** Includes all original referral documents, investigation plan, interview notes/recordings, expert reports, surveillance logs, photographic/video evidence, public records search results, communication logs, and the final investigative report.
*   **Retention:** SIU investigative files must be retained for a minimum of 7 years, or longer if required by state statute or ongoing litigation.
*   **Confidentiality:** Access to SIU case files is restricted to authorized SIU personnel, legal counsel, and claims management on a need-to-know basis.

## 9. Timelines

*   **Claims Handler Referral:** Within 2 business days of identifying significant fraud indicators.
*   **SIU Initial Review:** Within 48 hours of referral receipt.
*   **Investigation Plan Development:** Within 5 business days of assignment to an investigator.
*   **Investigation Conclusion:** Target completion within 60-90 days, depending on complexity. Complex cases may require extensions approved by SIU Manager.
*   **Claim Disposition (Post-SIU Decision):** Within 10 business days of SIU providing final findings (claim denial or return to claims processing).
*   **Law Enforcement Referral:** Within 5 business days of fraud substantiation approval by SIU management.

## 10. Exceptions

All exceptions to this protocol require documented approval from the SIU Manager and Legal Department. This includes deviations from standard investigative techniques, extended timelines, or determinations not explicitly covered in Section 6. Approvals must be recorded in the SIU case file.
