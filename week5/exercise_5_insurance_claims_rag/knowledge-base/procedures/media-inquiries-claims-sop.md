# SOP: Media Inquiries related to Claims

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the mandatory process and guidelines for handling all media inquiries or public relations issues that arise concerning ongoing or settled claims. The objective is to ensure consistent, accurate, and authorized communication with media outlets, protect the company's reputation, maintain claimant privacy, and comply with legal and regulatory requirements. This SOP applies to all employees, contractors, and third parties interacting with claims information.

## 2. Scope

This SOP applies to any direct or indirect contact from media representatives (e.g., journalists, reporters, TV crews, online news outlets, social media influencers seeking official comment) regarding a specific claim, a class of claims, or claims-related company policies or practices. It covers both proactive and reactive communications involving claims information.

This SOP specifically excludes general media inquiries unrelated to claims (e.g., corporate financial results, marketing campaigns, general company news), which are handled by the Corporate Communications department under a separate SOP.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Claimant:** The individual or entity who has filed a claim with the company.
*   **Media Inquiry:** Any request for information, comment, interview, or statement from a legitimate media outlet or journalist.
*   **Claims Media Liaison (CML):** A designated spokesperson from the Corporate Communications department, trained to handle media inquiries related to claims.
*   **Sensitive Claims Information:** Any data related to a claim that is subject to privacy laws (e.g., PII, PHI), financial details, investigative findings, or information that could negatively impact the claimant or company if disclosed improperly.
*   **Claims Representative:** Any employee directly involved in the processing or management of claims.
*   **Crisis Communications Plan:** A broader organizational plan for managing significant adverse events.

## 4. Procedure for Handling Media Inquiries

### 4.1. Initial Contact and Identification

**Step 1:** **Identify the Inquiry Source**
    *   Any employee receiving a media inquiry (via phone, email, social media, or in person) must immediately identify the caller/sender as a media representative.
    *   **Decision Logic:** If the caller states they are from a media outlet or asks questions indicative of media interest (e.g., "I'm a reporter from X, investigating Y claim."), proceed with this SOP. If unsure, treat as a media inquiry until confirmed otherwise.

**Step 2:** **Do NOT Provide Information**
    *   Under no circumstances should any employee (other than the designated Claims Media Liaison) provide any information, comment, or "off-the-record" statements to the media, regardless of the inquiry's nature or apparent urgency.
    *   State clearly but politely: "Our policy is to direct all media inquiries to our Corporate Communications department. I will ensure your request is forwarded to the appropriate spokesperson. Could I please have your name, media outlet, contact information, and a brief description of your inquiry?"
    *   Do NOT confirm or deny any claims, policy details, or individual identities.
    *   Do NOT speculate or offer personal opinions.

### 4.2. Immediate Notification and Escalation

**Step 3:** **Record and Notify**
    *   Immediately after receiving the media inquiry and collecting the details, the employee must log the incident in the "Claims Media Inquiry Log" (accessible via the company intranet under "Media Relations").
    *   The log entry must include:
        *   Date and Time of Inquiry
        *   Name of Media Representative
        *   Media Outlet
        *   Contact Information (phone, email)
        *   Brief Description of Inquiry
        *   Employee who received the inquiry
    *   Immediately notify the Claims Media Liaison (CML) and the relevant Claims Manager. For urgent or high-profile inquiries, also notify the Head of Corporate Communications and the Legal Department within 1 hour.
    *   **Notification Method:** Email and/or phone call, followed by an entry in the Claims Media Inquiry Log.

**Step 4:** **Forward All Information to CML**
    *   The Claims Manager, in coordination with the employee who received the inquiry, must immediately forward all known information pertaining to the claim(s) in question to the Claims Media Liaison.
    *   This includes: claim number(s), claimant details (for internal reference only), claim status, initial incident reports, and any relevant correspondence. Emphasize any known sensitivities or potential legal risks.

### 4.3. CML Response and Coordination

**Step 5:** **CML Assessment and Strategy**
    *   Upon receiving the notification, the Claims Media Liaison (CML) will:
        *   Review the media inquiry and assess its urgency and potential impact.
        *   Consult with the Claims Manager, Legal Department, and relevant subject matter experts to gather accurate information and understand the claim context.
        *   Determine if the inquiry involves sensitive claims information or falls under privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR, state-specific privacy laws).
        *   Coordinate with the Legal Department to ascertain any legal restrictions on disclosure.
        *   Develop a preliminary communication strategy, including key messages and potential responses (e.g., "no comment," general statement, detailed response if appropriate and authorized).

**Step 6:** **CML Response to Media**
    *   The CML will respond to the media inquiry within the requested timeframe, or within 4 business hours for standard inquiries, and within 1 business hour for urgent breaking news inquiries.
    *   The response will adhere to the agreed-upon communication strategy.
    *   **Decision Logic:**
        *   **If the inquiry involves private claimant data or active litigation:** The CML will typically issue a "no comment" statement or a general statement about respecting privacy and ongoing processes, along with a disclaimer that the company cannot discuss individual claims due to privacy and legal restrictions. Example: "Due to our strict privacy policies and legal obligations, we are unable to comment on specific claims. We are committed to processing all claims fairly and in accordance with applicable laws and policies."
        *   **If the inquiry is about a broad policy or general claim statistics (and pre-authorized for release):** The CML may provide a prepared statement or arrange an authorized spokesperson (e.g., Head of Claims, CEO) if deemed appropriate and approved by Legal and Senior Management.
        *   **If the inquiry is unfounded or based on misinformation:** The CML, in consultation with Legal, will prepare a factual, non-defamatory statement to correct inaccuracies without violating privacy.

**Step 7:** **Internal Communication and Post-Response Action**
    *   The CML will document the media interaction, including the exact statement or information provided, in the Claims Media Inquiry Log.
    *   The CML will notify the Claims Manager, Legal Department, and other relevant stakeholders of the response provided.
    *   The Claims Department should be prepared for potential follow-up questions from the claimant or other internal stakeholders once media attention is generated.

## 5. Requirements and Criteria

*   **Zero-Tolerance for Unauthorized Disclosure:** No claims representative or any employee outside of Corporate Communications is authorized to speak to the media about claims.
*   **Privacy First:** All media responses must prioritize claimant privacy and adhere to all applicable privacy laws (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA).
*   **Legal Review:** All statements pertaining to claims must be reviewed and approved by the Legal Department prior to release.
*   **Accuracy:** All communications must be factually accurate and truthful.
*   **Timeliness:** Media inquiries must be acknowledged and responded to within the established timeframes to maintain credibility.

## 6. Exceptions

*   In extreme crisis situations (e.g., major catastrophic events, class-action lawsuits with significant public attention), the Crisis Communications Plan takes precedence, and the Head of Corporate Communications will assume primary responsibility, coordinating closely with the CEO, Legal, and impacted departmental heads. However, the claims department's role in providing accurate claim data remains critical.

## 7. Evidence and Documentation

*   **Claims Media Inquiry Log:** Mandatory for all media contacts related to claims.
*   **Email Correspondence:** All internal and external email communications related to media inquiries.
*   **Approved Statements:** Copies of all official statements or press releases issued.
*   **Legal Review Approvals:** Documentation of legal department's review and approval for all public statements.

## 8. Timelines

*   **Initial Notification to CML:** Within 15 minutes of receiving a media inquiry.
*   **Claims Manager Information Forwarding:** Within 1 hour of notification.
*   **CML Acknowledgment to Media:** Within 1 business hour (urgent) or 4 business hours (standard).
*   **CML Response to Media:** As quickly as possible, aiming to meet media deadlines, typically within 24 hours.
*   **Internal Post-Response Notification:** Within 1 hour of the official media response.
