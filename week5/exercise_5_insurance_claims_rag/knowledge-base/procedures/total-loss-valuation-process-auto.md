# SOP: Total Loss Valuation Process (Auto)

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the mandatory steps and criteria for determining the Actual Cash Value (ACV) of a vehicle declared a total loss in an auto insurance claim. The purpose is to ensure fair, consistent, and accurate valuation practices, adhere to regulatory requirements, and facilitate efficient claim resolution for policyholders. This process ensures all relevant factors, including vehicle condition, mileage, options, and local market data, are considered to arrive at an equitable settlement amount.

## 2. Scope

This SOP applies to all auto claims where a vehicle has been deemed a total loss, either constructively (repair costs exceed a defined percentage of ACV) or physically (non-repairable damage). It covers all types of private passenger vehicles, light trucks, and motorcycles.

### 2.1. Inclusions

*   Vehicles damaged due to collision, comprehensive, or other covered perils resulting in a total loss declaration.
*   Vehicles subject to appraisal clause invocation.
*   Vehicles with unique modifications requiring specialized valuation.

### 2.2. Exclusions

*   Commercial fleet vehicles (refer to Commercial Claims SOP-104).
*   Heavy equipment, recreational vehicles (RVs), or watercraft (refer to Specialty Claims SOP-212).
*   Claims where the vehicle is recovered undamaged or repaired.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Actual Cash Value (ACV):** The fair market value of the vehicle immediately before the loss, considering factors such as make, model, year, mileage, condition, and options. It is not necessarily the purchase price or replacement cost.
*   **Total Loss Threshold:** The percentage of the vehicle's ACV beyond which repair costs are deemed uneconomical. For most states, this is typically between 70-80% of ACV, but can vary by state regulation.
*   **Constructive Total Loss:** A vehicle is deemed a constructive total loss when the cost to repair the damaged vehicle (including supplemental repairs, storage, and rental) plus the expected salvage value exceeds the Actual Cash Value, or when repair costs exceed the Total Loss Threshold.
*   **Physical Total Loss:** A vehicle that is so severely damaged it cannot be safely or economically repaired, irrespective of repair cost estimations (e.g., burned to the ground, submerged for an extended period).
*   **Market Data Report (MDR):** A comprehensive report generated by an approved third-party valuation service (e.g., CCC One, Mitchell, Audatex) that provides comparable vehicle sales data used to determine ACV.
*   **Salvage Value:** The estimated value of the damaged vehicle after a total loss, or its components, if sold.
*   **Condition Report:** A detailed assessment of the vehicle's pre-loss condition, documented by the appraiser or adjuster, noting wear and tear, damage, and maintenance history.

## 4. Total Loss Identification Criteria

A vehicle is identified as a potential total loss if any of the following conditions are met:

1.  **Initial Repair Estimate:** The initial repair estimate, including parts, labor, and paint, exceeds 65% of the estimated ACV (pre-inspection estimate).
2.  **Visible Damage:** Catastrophic damage is observed (e.g., frame damage beyond repair, severe fire damage, flood damage above dashboard).
3.  **State Total Loss Threshold:** Repair costs, plus potential supplements and associated costs (e.g., rental, storage), are likely to exceed the state-mandated total loss threshold.
    *   **Example State Thresholds:**
        *   California: Repair cost + salvage value > ACV (Economic Total Loss)
        *   Texas: Repair cost > 100% ACV
        *   Florida: Repair cost > 80% ACV

## 5. Procedures for Total Loss Valuation

### 5.1. Step 1: Initial Claim Setup and Damage Assessment

1.  **Claim Assignment:** Assign the vehicle claim to a qualified Auto Total Loss Adjuster.
2.  **Initial Contact:** Adjuster contacts policyholder/claimant to gather vehicle details (VIN, mileage, options, pre-loss condition, maintenance records, photos if available).
3.  **Damage Inspection:** If not already performed, an appraisal is conducted by a field appraiser or desk reviewer to document the extent of damage and generate an initial repair estimate. High-quality photos of the damage and the entire vehicle are mandatory.
4.  **Proof of Ownership:** Obtain clear title or equivalent proof of ownership documents.

### 5.2. Step 2: Vehicle Information Verification and Pre-Loss Condition Assessment

1.  **VIN Decode:** Verify VIN against policy records and decode to confirm make, model, year, trim level, and original equipment options.
2.  **Mileage Verification:** Record current mileage from inspection or policyholder declaration.
3.  **Condition Documentation:**
    *   **Primary Source:** Appraiser's physical inspection and detailed condition report.
    *   **Secondary Sources:** Policyholder/claimant declaration, pre-loss photos, maintenance records, previous repair history, CarFax/AutoCheck reports (if available and deemed reliable).
    *   **Tiered Condition Rating:**
        *   **Excellent:** Showroom condition, meticulously maintained, low mileage for age.
        *   **Good:** Well-maintained, minor wear consistent with age/mileage, no significant cosmetic or mechanical defects.
        *   **Fair:** Moderate wear and tear, some cosmetic imperfections, potential minor mechanical issues, average maintenance.
        *   **Poor:** Significant cosmetic damage, multiple mechanical issues, lack of maintenance, high mileage for age.
4.  **Confirm Options:** Explicitly list all factory-installed and significant aftermarket options (e.g., premium sound system, navigation, sunroof, custom wheels, performance upgrades). Document with VIN decode and policyholder confirmation.

### 5.3. Step 3: Obtain Market Data Report (MDR)

1.  **System Selection:** Utilize approved third-party valuation systems (e.g., CCC One, Mitchell, Audatex). Prioritize systems based on state regulations and established company contracts.
2.  **Data Entry:** Input confirmed vehicle details (VIN, make, model, year, trim, mileage, options, pre-loss condition).
3.  **Comparable Selection:** The valuation system generates a list of comparable vehicles. The adjuster must review these comparables carefully.
    *   **Minimum Comparables:** Aim for at least **3-5** relevant comparable vehicles sold or listed recently within a **100-mile radius** (or closer, depending on population density) of the loss location.
    *   **Acceptable Deviation:** Comparables should generally be within ±2 years model year, ±25,000 miles, and similar trim levels.
    *   **Manual Adjustments:** If automatic comparables are not adequate, the adjuster *must* manually search for more suitable comparables from reputable sources (e.g., certified dealer websites, major online auto marketplaces with VIN verification) and justify their inclusion or exclusion.
4.  **MDR Review and Adjustments:**
    *   **Condition Adjustment:** Review the condition adjustments applied by the system. If the pre-loss condition assessment warrants a deviation, a detailed justification must be documented.
        *   **Example Justification:** "System assigned 'Fair' condition, but policyholder provided extensive maintenance records and pre-loss photos demonstrating 'Good' condition, meriting an upward adjustment of $X."
    *   **Mileage Adjustment:** Verify mileage adjustments.
    *   **Option Adjustments:** Ensure all significant options are correctly accounted for and valued. Manually add unlisted aftermarket options and provide documented proof of value (e.g., original receipts, expert appraisal).
    *   **Local Market Factors:** Consider any unique local market conditions not captured by the system (e.g., regional demand for specific vehicles, recent natural disasters impacting supply). Document any manual adjustments.
5.  **Salvage Value Assessment:** Obtain a preliminary salvage bid if required by state law or if local salvage yards offer immediate quotes.

### 5.4. Step 4: Calculate Actual Cash Value (ACV) and Total Loss Decision

1.  **Final ACV Determination:** Based on the reviewed MDR and any justified manual adjustments, determine the vehicle's ACV.
2.  **Total Loss Calculation:**
    *   Compare the estimated cost of repairs (including supplements, storage, and rental costs) + anticipated salvage value against the determined ACV.
    *   Alternatively, compare the estimated cost of repairs against the state-specific Total Loss Threshold applied to the ACV.
    *   **Decision Logic:** If (Repair Cost + Associated Costs + Salvage Value) >= ACV OR (Repair Cost + Associated Costs) >= (ACV * State Total Loss Threshold Percentage), then the vehicle is declared a total loss.
3.  **Documentation:** Thoroughly document the ACV calculation, including the MDR, all adjustments made, and the total loss decision logic in the claim file.

### 5.5. Step 5: Communicate Total Loss Resolution

1.  **Policyholder/Claimant Notification:** Clearly explain the total loss declaration, the ACV settlement amount, and the breakdown of the valuation (MDR summary). Provide a copy of the final valuation report.
2.  **Required Forms:** Provide necessary release forms, power of attorney for title transfer, and any state-specific total loss forms.
3.  **Title Transfer:** Guide the policyholder through the process of transferring the vehicle title to the insurer or salvage buyer. Ensure all liens are satisfied.
4.  **Salvage Disposal:** Facilitate the pickup and disposal of the salvage vehicle through an approved salvage auction or vendor.

## 6. Requirements and Criteria

*   **Timeliness:** Total loss valuations must be completed within **5 business days** of receiving all necessary vehicle information and damage documentation, where possible, subject to state regulations.
*   **Accuracy:** All valuations must be supported by market data and adhere to company guidelines and state regulations.
*   **Transparency:** All valuation decisions and adjustments must be clearly documented and defensible, providing full transparency to the policyholder.
*   **Compliance:** Adherence to all relevant state insurance department regulations regarding total loss valuation and settlement.
*   **Manager Approval:** All total loss settlements exceeding **$50,000** or those involving unique, heavily modified vehicles require manager approval prior to settlement offer.

## 7. Exceptions

*   **Agreed Value Policies:** For policies with an explicit "agreed value" clause, the agreed value supersedes the ACV valuation process, provided the damage meets the definition of a total loss.
*   **Disputed Valuations/Appraisal Clause:** If a policyholder disputes the valuation, the appraisal clause in the policy may be invoked. The adjuster will follow the specific Appraisal Clause Procedure (SOP-009). All appraisal clause cases require senior adjuster or manager approval.
*   **Unavailable Market Data:** In rare cases of extremely rare or unique vehicles where sufficient market data is unavailable from standard systems, an independent certified auto appraiser may be required. This requires manager pre-approval.

## 8. Evidence/Documentation

The following documents must be secured in the claim file for every total loss claim:

*   Police Report (if applicable)
*   Initial Claim Report (First Notice of Loss)
*   Policy Declarations Page
*   Proof of Ownership (Title, Registration, Purchase Agreement)
*   Detailed Pre-Loss Condition Report (by appraiser/adjuster)
*   High-resolution photos of vehicle pre-loss (if available) and post-loss damage photos
*   VIN Decode Report
*   Vehicle History Report (e.g., CarFax, AutoCheck)
*   Estimated Repair Costs (if any repair estimate was generated)
*   Market Data Report (MDR) used for ACV calculation, including comparables
*   Adjuster's detailed valuation worksheet with all adjustments justified
*   Salvage bid/quote
*   Total Loss Notification Letter to Policyholder/Claimant
*   Release of Liability and Power of Attorney forms
*   Settlement calculation and payment authorization
*   All communications with policyholder/claimant regarding valuation

## 9. Timelines

*   **Initial Contact:** Within 24 business hours of total loss identification.
*   **ACV Determination:** Within 5 business days of receiving all necessary information.
*   **Settlement Offer:** Within 2 business days of ACV determination.
*   **Payment Issuance:** Within 3 business days of receiving signed release and clear title.
*   **Salvage Pick-up:** Within 7 business days of title transfer.
