# Process: Initiating Subrogation Claims

## 1. Overview
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the step-by-step process for identifying, evaluating, and initiating subrogation opportunities for eligible claims. The primary goal is to recover payments made by Acme Insurance Co. from responsible third parties, minimizing financial losses and ensuring fair compensation practices. This process applies to all lines of business where subrogation is a potential recovery mechanism.

## 2. Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a clear, consistent, and efficient framework for claim representatives to follow when handling subrogatable claims. Adherence to this procedure ensures maximum recovery rates, compliance with legal requirements, and standardized documentation across all subrogation efforts.

## 3. Scope
This SOP applies to all claim adjusters, supervisors, and subrogation specialists involved in the claims handling process at Acme Insurance Co. It covers all claim types (e.g., auto collision, property, workers' compensation, general liability) where a third party may be legally responsible for damages paid by Acme Insurance Co.

**Inclusions:**
*   Identification of third-party liability
*   Assessment of subrogation potential
*   Notification to third parties and their insurers
*   Referral to subrogation department

**Exclusions:**
*   Detailed subrogation negotiation tactics (handled by specialist department)
*   Legal actions beyond initial demand letters (handled by legal department)
*   Claims with no identifiable third-party liability

## 4. Definitions
*   **Subrogation:** The right for an insurer to pursue a third party that caused an insurance loss to the insured. This is done to recover the amount of the claim paid by the insurer to the insured.
*   **Third Party:** An individual or entity identified as legally responsible for damages or losses incurred by the insured.
*   **Claim File:** The complete record of a claim, including all documentation, correspondence, and financial transactions.
*   **Notice of Subrogation:** A formal communication informing a third party or their insurer that Acme Insurance Co. intends to pursue recovery for payments made.
*   **Recovery Potential:** The estimated amount or likelihood of successfully recovering funds through subrogation.

## 5. Responsibilities
*   **Claim Adjuster (Primary):** Responsible for initial claim investigation, identification of subrogation potential, and gathering necessary evidence.
*   **Claim Supervisor:** Responsible for reviewing subrogation referrals, approving initial demand amounts, and ensuring compliance with this SOP.
*   **Subrogation Specialist:** Responsible for managing demand, negotiation, and recovery efforts once a claim is referred.

## 6. Procedures: Initiation of Subrogation Claims

### 6.1. Step 1: Initial Claim Investigation and Liability Assessment
**Action:** The assigned claim adjuster conducts a thorough investigation of the claim event.
**Details:**
*   Gather all facts, statements (insured, witnesses), police reports, photos, and relevant documents.
*   Determine fault and liability for the incident.
*   Assess if a third party contributed to or is solely responsible for the loss.
**Decision Logic:**
*   **If 100% Acme insured at fault (or no third party identifiable):** Proceed to standard claim closure, no subrogation.
*   **If third party 50% or more at fault:** Potentially subrogatable. Proceed to Step 2.
*   **If third party negligence is questionable but possible:** Mark claim for further review regarding subrogation potential during settlement, proceed to Step 2.

### 6.2. Step 2: Identify Subrogation Potential
**Action:** Evaluate the financial and feasibility aspects of pursuing subrogation.
**Criteria for Identification:**
*   **Clear Third-Party Liability:** Evidence strongly indicates the third party caused the loss.
*   **Recoverable Damages:** Acme Insurance Co. has made or anticipates making payments exceeding the minimum threshold of `$500` (for property) or `$1,000` (for auto/liability) or has paid for non-deductible items.
*   **Identifiable Third Party:** Name, contact information, and/or insurance details of the third party are available.
*   **Third-Party Solvency/Insurance:** Reasonable expectation that the third party or their insurer can satisfy a recovery demand.
**Evidence/Documentation:**
*   Police Report (if applicable)
*   Witness Statements
*   Photos/Videos of loss
*   Acme Insurance Co. settlement details (payments made, estimates, deductible amount)
*   Third-party contact information

### 6.3. Step 3: Secure Evidence and Documentation
**Action:** Collect and organize all necessary documentation to support the subrogation claim.
**Details:**
*   Obtain certified copies of police reports.
*   Secure repair estimates, invoices, and proof of payment.
*   Gather medical records and bills (for BI claims).
*   Document any communication with the insured or third party regarding liability.
*   Preserve any physical evidence if necessary (e.g., vehicle, damaged property).
**Timeline:**
*   Evidence collection should ideally be completed within 30 days of initial claim filing or liability determination.

### 6.4. Step 4: Issue Notice of Subrogation and Initial Demand (if applicable)
**Action:** Notify the at-fault third party and/or their insurance carrier of Acme Insurance Co.'s subrogation interest.
**Procedure:**
1.  **Generate Notice:** Use the standard "Subrogation Notice Letter" template (ClaimForms-007).
2.  **Content:** Letter must include:
    *   Acme Insurance Co. claim number
    *   Date of loss
    *   Insured's name
    *   Brief description of the incident
    *   Reason for subrogation (Acme payment amount)
    *   Third party's name and contact information
    *   Demand for repayment of specific amounts (if known and claim is closed)
    *   Request for third-party insurance information (if not already known)
3.  **Delivery:** Send via certified mail with return receipt requested, and via email if an email address is available.
**Criteria:**
*   Notice must be sent within 60 days of the first payment made by Acme Insurance Co. on the claim, or within 30 days of definitive third-party liability determination, whichever is sooner.
*   If the third party's insurance carrier is known, direct initial communication to them.

### 6.5. Step 5: Transfer to Subrogation Department
**Action:** Once the notice has been sent and initial evidence gathered, formal referral to the dedicated Subrogation Department is required.
**Procedure:**
1.  **Complete Subrogation Referral Form:** Fill out "Subrogation Referral Form" (ClaimForms-012) in the claim system.
2.  **Attach Documentation:** Ensure all collected evidence (police reports, photos, estimates, proof of payment, correspondence) is uploaded to the claim file and linked to the referral form.
3.  **Supervisor Review:** The claim supervisor must review and approve the referral within 5 business days.
4.  **System Update:** Mark the claim status in the claims management system as "Referred to Subrogation."
**Required Documentation for Transfer:**
*   Completed Subrogation Referral Form.
*   Copy of the Notice of Subrogation and proof of delivery.
*   All claim payment details and supporting invoices.
*   Relevant police reports, witness statements, and incident reports.
*   Any communication with the third party or their insurer.
*   Deductible payment information.
**Decision Logic for Referral:**
*   **Refer:** If all criteria in Step 2 are met, and notice has been issued.
*   **Do Not Refer (Close Subro Opportunity):**
    *   If total recoverable amount is less than `$500` after initial payments.
    *   If the third party is unidentifiable or uninsured and judgment-proof.
    *   If the statute of limitations is less than 6 months away.
    *   If liability determination is 50/50 or less in Acme's favor and the recovery potential does not justify the effort.
    *   Must be approved by a Claim Supervisor, with clear documentation in the claim file.

## 7. Exceptions
*   **Small Claims/Low Value:** Claims with a subrogation potential under `$2,500` for property damage or `$1,000` for auto/liability may be closed without referral to the Subrogation Department if approved by a claim supervisor. The reason for non-referral must be thoroughly documented.
*   **Insured Request:** If the insured explicitly requests not to pursue subrogation and there is no contractual obligation to do so, a written waiver from the insured may be obtained (Form W-003) and the case closed, subject to supervisor approval.
*   **Statute of Limitations:** If the subrogation opportunity is identified with less than 6 months remaining on the applicable statute of limitations, an immediate expedited review by the Subrogation Department Manager is required to determine viability.

## 8. Timelines
*   **Initial Identity of Potential:** Within 7 business days of loss reporting or receipt of critical liability documents.
*   **Notice of Subrogation Sent:** Within 60 days of first payment or 30 days of definitive liability determination.
*   **Evidence Gathering Completion:** Within 30 days of liability determination.
*   **Referral to Subrogation Department:** Within 15 business days of sending the Notice of Subrogation.
*   **Supervisor Approval of Referral:** Within 5 business days of referral submission.

## 9. Evidence/Documentation Requirements
All documentation related to subrogation initiation must be uploaded to the electronic claim file within the "Subrogation" subfolder. This includes:
*   Subrogation Notice Letters (sent).
*   Certified mail receipts.
*   All documents supporting liability and damages.
*   Internal Subrogation Referral Forms.
*   Supervisor approval notes.
*   Any correspondence from the third party or their insurer.
