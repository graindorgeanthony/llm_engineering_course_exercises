# Guide: Policyholder Interview Techniques

## 1. Overview/Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines best practices and standardized techniques for adjusters conducting interviews with policyholders regarding their insurance claims. The primary purpose is to ensure consistent, thorough, and empathetic information gathering, facilitate accurate claim assessment, mitigate potential disputes, and enhance policyholder satisfaction throughout the claims process. Adherence to these guidelines helps in efficient claim resolution and maintains the integrity of the claims investigation.

## 2. Scope

This guide applies to all claims adjusters, claims handlers, and claims support staff responsible for direct communication and information collection from policyholders across all lines of business (e.g., auto, property, liability, health). It covers initial claim intake interviews, follow-up inquiries, and dispute resolution conversations. This SOP does not cover interviews with third-party witnesses or expert consultants, which are addressed in a separate document.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Adjuster:** An individual responsible for investigating and settling insurance claims.
*   **Policyholder:** The individual or entity insured under an insurance policy.
*   **Claim Interview:** A structured conversation between an adjuster and a policyholder to gather facts, circumstances, and details pertinent to an insurance claim.
*   **Active Listening:** A communication technique where the listener fully concentrates, understands, responds, and remembers what is being said.
*   **Empathy:** The ability to understand and share the feelings of another.
*   **Statement:** A written or recorded account provided by the policyholder, summarizing the facts of the claim.

## 4. Pre-Interview Preparation

Before initiating contact with a policyholder, adjusters must complete the following preparation steps:

### 4.1 Review Claim File

*   Thoroughly review all existing documentation related to the claim (e.g., First Notice of Loss (FNOL), policy declarations, previous correspondence, photos).
*   Identify policy limits, deductibles, coverage exclusions, and applicable endorsements.
*   Note any specific issues or red flags identified during initial review (e.g., discrepancies in reported facts, signs of potential fraud).
*   Formulate a list of key questions to address during the interview based on the claim type and initial information.

### 4.2 Establish Interview Objectives

*   Clearly define what information needs to be obtained from the policyholder.
*   Determine the desired outcome of the interview (e.g., fact confirmation, details on damages, clarification of events, understanding policyholder expectations).

### 4.3 Select Appropriate Interview Method

*   **Telephone Interview:** Default for initial contact and simple claims.
*   **Video Conference:** Recommended for complex claims, visual assessment needs, or when personal connection is crucial but in-person is not feasible. Ensure policyholder has necessary technology.
*   **In-Person Interview:** Reserved for high-value claims, severe property damage assessments, or when a detailed on-site investigation is required. Requires scheduling and logistical considerations.

### 4.4 Prepare Interview Environment

*   Ensure a quiet, private setting for the interview, free from distractions.
*   Have necessary tools ready: claim file, notepad, pen, recording device (if applicable and consented to), policy information.

## 5. Interview Procedure

### 5.1 Introduction and Consent (First 5 minutes)

1.  **Self-Introduction:** State your name, title, and purpose for calling/meeting.
    *   *Example: "Hello, my name is [Adjuster Name], and I'm a Claims Adjuster with [Company Name]. I'm calling regarding your claim, [Claim Number]."*
2.  **Confirm Identity:** Verify you are speaking with the policyholder or an authorized representative.
3.  **Explain Purpose:** Clearly state the objective of the interview and what information you hope to gather.
4.  **Assure Confidentiality:** Reassure the policyholder about the confidential nature of the discussion.
5.  **Obtain Consent for Recording (If Applicable):** If recording the interview, explicitly ask for and obtain verbal consent. Document consent in the file.
    *   *Decision Logic: If consent is denied, do NOT record. Proceed with detailed written notes.*
6.  **Set Expectations:** Briefly outline the estimated duration of the interview and the next steps in the claims process.

### 5.2 Information Gathering (Main Body)

1.  **Open-Ended Questions:** Begin with broad questions to allow the policyholder to tell their story in their own words.
    *   *Example: "Could you please describe, to the best of your recollection, what happened on [Date of Loss]?"*
    *   *Example: "Can you walk me through the sequence of events from when you first noticed the damage?"*
2.  **Active Listening:**
    *   Pay full attention, avoid interruptions.
    *   Take detailed notes.
    *   Use verbal affirmations (e.g., "I understand," "Go on," "Yes").
    *   Paraphrase or summarize periodically to confirm understanding.
        *   *Example: "So, if I'm understanding correctly, the main impact was to the front right of the vehicle, is that accurate?"*
3.  **Specific Probing Questions:** Once the initial narrative is complete, ask targeted questions to fill in gaps, clarify details, and obtain specific facts.
    *   **Who:** Involved parties, witnesses.
    *   **What:** Specific damage, items lost/stolen, actions taken.
    *   **When:** Date, time, duration of events.
    *   **Where:** Location of incident, location of damaged property.
    *   **Why/How:** Policyholder's understanding of the cause, sequence of events.
    *   *Example: "Did you notice any other vehicles in the intersection at the time?"*
    *   *Example: "Can you approximate the time you first noticed the water leak?"*
    *   *Example: "What steps did you take immediately after the incident to prevent further damage?"*
4.  **Maintain Professional Demeanor:** Remain objective, calm, and empathetic, even if the policyholder becomes emotional or frustrated. Avoid leading questions or expressing personal opinions.
5.  **Address Discrepancies:** If discrepancies arise between the policyholder's statement and other available information, address them tactfully and professionally.
    *   *Example: "The initial police report mentions X, but you're stating Y. Can you help me understand the difference?"*
6.  **Document All Questions and Answers:** Ensure all material questions asked and the policyholder's responses are accurately recorded.

### 5.3 Clarification and Confirmation (Last 5-10 minutes)

1.  **Summarize Key Information:** Briefly summarize the critical facts and details gathered during the interview to ensure accuracy and mutual understanding.
    *   *Example: "To confirm, my notes indicate that the incident occurred on [Date] at approximately [Time], involving [Parties], and the primary damage is [Description]. Is that correct?"*
2.  **Address Policyholder Questions:** Offer the policyholder an opportunity to ask questions about the process, coverage, or next steps.
3.  **Explain Next Steps:** Clearly outline what will happen next in the claims process, including timelines for investigation, potential inspections, and communication.
    *   *Example: "Next, we will arrange for an adjuster to inspect the property by [Date]. You can expect a call from them within [Number] business days."*
4.  **Confirm Preferred Contact Method:** Verify how the policyholder prefers to be contacted for future updates.
5.  **Express Empathy and Closure:** Thank the policyholder for their time and cooperation, and reiterate commitment to assisting them through the claim.

## 6. Post-Interview Actions

### 6.1 Documentation

*   **Contemporaneous Notes:** Ensure all notes taken during the interview are clear, comprehensive, and objective.
*   **Interview Summary/Statement:** Prepare a formal summary of the interview or a written/recorded statement for the claim file within 24 hours of the interview.
*   Include date, time, location, attendees, duration, and key discussion points.
*   If a recorded statement was taken, ensure it is properly transcribed or indexed and uploaded to the claim file.
*   **Policyholder Review (Optional for Written Statements):** For complex claims or detailed written statements, offer the policyholder an opportunity to review and sign the statement to confirm accuracy.
    *   *Decision Logic: If policyholder review is not feasible or declined, document the reason.*

### 6.2 Update Claim File

*   Immediately update the claim management system with new information obtained, revised estimates, or changes in claim direction.
*   Log all communications, including attempts to contact.

### 6.3 Follow-up Actions

*   Initiate any necessary follow-up actions identified during the interview (e.g., scheduling inspections, requesting additional documents, contacting third parties).
*   Send a thank-you email or letter recapping next steps if appropriate.

## 7. Requirements/Criteria

*   All adjusters must complete annual training on effective communication and interviewing techniques.
*   All interviews must be conducted in compliance with relevant state and federal regulations regarding privacy and consumer protection.
*   Consent for recording must be obtained prior to recording any portion of an interview.
*   Adjusters must maintain impartiality and objectivity throughout the interview process.

## 8. Exceptions

*   **Emergency Situations:** In cases where immediate action is required to prevent further loss or ensure safety (e.g., life-threatening injury, severe property damage requiring urgent mitigation), initial information gathering may be abbreviated to facilitate rapid response. Detailed follow-up interviews must still occur as soon as practicable.
*   **Policyholder Incapacity:** If the policyholder is unable to provide a coherent statement due to injury, emotional distress, or cognitive impairment, arrangements must be made to interview an authorized representative or wait until the policyholder is able. Document the reason for delay or alternative contact.
