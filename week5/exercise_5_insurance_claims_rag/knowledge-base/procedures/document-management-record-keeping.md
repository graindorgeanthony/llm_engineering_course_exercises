# SOP: Document Management and Record Keeping

## 1. Overview/Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the process for the standardized organization, storage, retrieval, and retention of all claim-related documents and records within the Claims Department. The purpose is to ensure accuracy, accessibility, compliance with regulatory requirements (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR, state-specific insurance regulations), and efficient claim processing. Adherence to this SOP minimizes data loss, streamlines audits, and supports robust decision-making by claims adjusting personnel.

## 2. Scope

This SOP applies to all employees, contractors, and agents involved in the creation, receipt, processing, or management of documents and records pertaining to insurance claims handled by [Your Company Name]. This includes, but is not limited to, claims adjusters, claims support staff, supervisors, and legal department personnel accessing claim files.

### 2.1. Inclusions

*   Policy documents, endorsements, and declarations
*   First Notice of Loss (FNOL) reports and incident reports
*   Claim forms and applications
*   Correspondence (emails, letters, faxes) with policyholders, third parties, legal counsel, and vendors
*   Investigation reports (e.g., adjusters' notes, scene photos, witness statements, police reports)
*   Medical records, bills, and reports (for health, auto bodily injury, and workers' compensation claims)
*   Repair estimates, invoices, and appraisal reports
*   Subrogation and salvage documentation
*   Legal documents (e.g., summons, complaints, court orders, settlement agreements)
*   Payment records and financial ledgers
*   Internal memos, approvals, and decision logs
*   Audio recordings (e.g., recorded statements) and video files (e.g., drone footage, surveillance)

### 2.2. Exclusions

*   General administrative documents not directly related to a specific claim file (e.g., HR records, general company invoices).
*   Marketing materials.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Claim File:** The complete collection of all documents, records, and information (physical or electronic) pertaining to a specific insurance claim.
*   **Document:** Any recorded information, regardless of medium or characteristics (e.g., paper, electronic file, audio, video).
*   **Record:** Information created, received, and maintained as evidence by an organization or person, in pursuance of legal obligations or in the transaction of business. All records are documents, but not all documents are records.
*   **Electronic Document Management System (EDMS):** The primary digital system used for storing, organizing, and managing electronic claim documents (e.g., SharePoint, bespoke claims software).
*   **Retention Schedule:** A timeline specifying how long different types of records must be kept before they can be destroyed.
*   **Metadata:** Data that describes other data (e.g., creation date, author, claim number, document type). Essential for search and retrieval.
*   **PHI (Protected Health Information):** Individually identifiable health information transmitted or maintained in any form or medium (e.g., medical records).
*   **Personally Identifiable Information (PII):** Information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, either alone or when combined with other personal or identifying information.

### 4.1. Document Creation and Naming Conventions

All documents created or received must be associated with the relevant claim file immediately.

#### 4.1.1. Electronic Documents
*   **Standard Naming Convention:** All electronic documents must follow the format: `[ClaimNumber]_[DocumentType]_[Date_YYYYMMDD]_[BriefDescription].ext`
    *   **Example:** `ABC12345_MedicalReport_20231025_PatientXHospital.pdf`
    *   **Example:** `ABC12345_Correspondence_20231026_InsuredEmailRegardingDamage.msg`
    *   **Example:** `ABC12345_AdjusterNotes_20231025_InitialInvestigation.docx`
*   **Document Type List:** A predefined list of document types will be maintained within the EDMS (e.g., "FNOL," "Estimate," "Invoice," "Medical Record," "Policy," "Correspondence"). Users must select the most appropriate type.
*   **Metadata Tagging:** Upon upload to the EDMS, documents must be tagged with mandatory metadata, including:
    *   Claim Number
    *   Policy Number
    *   Date of Loss
    *   Date of Document Creation/Receipt
    *   Document Type (from predefined list)
    *   Author/Source
    *   Keyword Tags (optional, for enhanced searchability)

#### 4.1.2. Physical Documents
*   All incoming physical mail and faxes must be scanned and uploaded to the EDMS within 24 business hours of receipt.
*   The original physical document should be retained in a secure location until digitizations are verified and then may be securely shredded according to the retention schedule, or as required by specific legal directives (e.g., certain original death certificates, wills).
*   Physical claim files are to be maintained only for specific categories as designated by the Legal Department or Compliance Officer.

### 4.2. Document Storage and Organization

All claim documents, whether electronic or physical, must be stored in a manner that ensures security, integrity, and retrievability.

#### 4.2.1. Electronic Document Management System (EDMS)
*   The EDMS is the primary repository for all claim records.
*   Claim files within the EDMS are organized by a unique claim number.
*   Folder structure within each claim number will follow a standard template:
    *   `[Claim Number]`
        *   `├─── Policy & Coverage`
        *   `├─── FNOL & Initial Report`
        *   `├─── Correspondence`
        *   `├─── Investigation & Evidence`
        *   `│    ├─── Adjuster Notes`
        *   `│    ├─── Photos & Video`
        *   `│    ├─── Witness Statements`
        *   `│    └─── Police Reports`
        *   `├─── Estimates & Invoices`
        *   `├─── Medical Records` (if applicable, with restricted access)
        *   `├─── Legal & Subrogation`
        *   `├─── Payments & Reserves`
        *   `└─── Internal Approvals`
*   Access to the EDMS is controlled by user roles and permissions, ensuring data security and privacy compliance (e.g., PHI access restricted to authorized personnel).
*   All actions within the EDMS (upload, view, modify, delete) are logged for audit purposes.

#### 4.2.2. Physical Document Storage
*   Physical records, if maintained, must be stored in locked cabinets or secure storage rooms.
*   Boxes must be clearly labeled with Claim Numbers and destruction dates.
*   Access to physical storage areas is restricted to authorized personnel only.

### 4.3. Document Retrieval

*   All claims personnel are expected to retrieve documents primarily through the EDMS search functionality.
*   Effective searching is facilitated by adherence to naming conventions and metadata tagging.
*   Users can search by:
    *   Claim Number
    *   Policy Number
    *   Insured Name
    *   Date Ranges (Date of Loss, Date of Document)
    *   Document Type
    *   Keywords
*   For complex retrieval requests or data analytics, contact the IT Department or designated Data Analyst.

### 4.4. Record Retention and Disposal

All records must be retained according to the company's official Record Retention Schedule. This schedule adheres to federal, state, and local regulations, as well as industry best practices.
