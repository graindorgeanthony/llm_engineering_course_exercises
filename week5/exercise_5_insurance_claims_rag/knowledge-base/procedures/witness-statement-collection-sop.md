# SOP: Witness Statement Collection

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the process for identifying, approaching, interviewing, and documenting statements from witnesses to incidents relevant to claims processing. The purpose of this SOP is to ensure a consistent, thorough, and legally sound approach to witness statement collection, critical for factual reconstruction, liability assessment, and fair claim resolution. Adherence to this procedure helps gather accurate information, maintain chain of custody for evidence, and mitigate potential disputes or legal challenges.

## 2. Scope

This SOP applies to all claims adjusters, investigators, and authorized personnel involved in the claims management process who are tasked with collecting witness accounts for any incident type (e.g., property damage, personal injury, vehicle accidents, business interruption).

### 2.1 Inclusions
*   Identification of potential witnesses.
*   Initial contact and scheduling of interviews.
*   Conducting structured interviews.
*   Documenting witness statements (written, recorded).
*   Handling reluctant or uncooperative witnesses.
*   Securing witness signatures and affirmations.

### 2.2 Exclusions
*   Legal advice provided by counsel.
*   Forensic examination procedures.
*   Collection of physical evidence other than statements.
*   Interviews with minors without parental/guardian consent (requires specific legal guidance).

## 3. Definitions

*   **Witness:** An individual who has direct sensory perception of an incident (saw, heard, felt, smelled, etc.) or possesses relevant information pertaining to it.
*   **Statement:** A formal declaration by a witness outlining their account of an incident, typically in written or recorded form.
*   **Incident:** Any event giving rise to a claim, including accidents, damage, losses, or other occurrences requiring investigation.

## 4. Procedure: Witness Statement Collection

### 4.1 Step 1: Witness Identification and Prioritization

1.  **Review Incident Report:** Scrutinize initial incident reports, police reports, and claimant statements for any mention of potential witnesses.
2.  **Scene Survey (if applicable):** If visiting the incident scene, look for individuals who might have been present, local businesses with surveillance, or signage seeking witnesses.
3.  **Cross-Reference:** Compare information from various sources to identify discrepancies that might highlight the need for specific witness input.
4.  **Prioritize:**
    *   **Primary Witnesses:** Individuals with direct observation of the main event.
    *   **Secondary Witnesses:** Individuals with observations just before, during, or immediately after the event, or those with relevant background information.
    *   Prioritize based on proximity to the event, perceived objectivity, and potential for unique information.

### 4.2 Step 2: Initial Contact and Scheduling

1.  **Method of Contact:**
    *   **Telephone:** Preferred for initial contact to assess willingness and schedule.
    *   **Email/Letter:** Acceptable if phone contact fails or for formal follow-up.
    *   **In-Person:** If at the scene or if other methods are unsuccessful and location is known. Use caution and ensure safety.
2.  **Disclosure:** Clearly state identity (name, company, role) and purpose of contact (investigating an incident related to a claim, seeking their account).
3.  **Neutrality:** Avoid leading questions or implying blame. State the intention is to gather facts from their perspective.
4.  **Schedule:** Propose a convenient time and location for an interview. Offer flexibility (phone interview, in-person, video call).
5.  **Confidentiality:** Inform the witness that their statement will be used for claims investigation and may be shared with relevant parties, including legal counsel, in accordance with applicable laws and privacy policies.

### 4.3 Step 3: Conducting the Interview

1.  **Preparation:**
    *   Review all existing incident documentation.
    *   Prepare a list of open-ended questions.
    *   Ensure recording equipment (if used) is functional and consented to.
    *   Have necessary forms (witness statement form, consent forms) ready.
2.  **Introduction:**
    *   Re-introduce yourself and explain the purpose of the interview.
    *   Confirm the witness's willingness to provide a statement.
    *   Explain the process: they will recount their observations, you will ask clarifying questions, and the statement will be documented.
    *   **Obtain Consent for Recording:** If recording, explicitly ask for and obtain verbal consent at the beginning of the recording. State this consent on the record.
3.  **Open-Ended Narrative:**
    *   Begin with a broad, open-ended question: "Can you please tell me in your own words everything you saw or heard regarding the incident on [date] at [location]?"
    *   Allow the witness to speak without interruption as much as possible.
4.  **Clarification and Detail:**
    *   After the initial narrative, ask clarifying questions using the 5 W's and H (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How).
    *   Ask about specific details: colors, directions, speeds, sounds, distances, other people involved, weather conditions.
    *   "Can you describe the vehicle more specifically?"
    *   "How far were you from the incident when it occurred?"
    *   "What did you do immediately after seeing/hearing that?"
5.  **Address Discrepancies:** Gently address any inconsistencies between the witness's account and other known facts, asking for clarification.
6.  **Avoid Leading Questions:** Frame questions neutrally. Instead of "Did you see the driver run the red light?", ask "What color was the light when the vehicle entered the intersection?"
7.  **Identify Potential Bias:** Be aware of potential biases (e.g., relationship to parties involved, prior experience) but do not accuse. Document any concerns regarding credibility.
8.  **Concluding the Interview:**
    *   Ask: "Is there anything else you recall or wish to add?"
    *   Thank the witness for their time and cooperation.
    *   Explain the next steps (statement drafting, review).

### 4.4 Step 4: Documenting the Statement

Witness statements can be documented in various forms, prioritizing clarity, accuracy, and completeness.

#### 4.4.1 Written Statement (Preferred Method)

1.  **Drafting:** Immediately after the interview (or during, if witness is comfortable), draft the statement in clear, concise language, using the witness's own words as much as possible. Avoid jargon.
2.  **Format:**
    *   Witness's full name, address, phone number, email.
    *   Date and time of statement.
    *   Date, time, and location of incident.
    *   Introduction: "I, [Witness Name], residing at [Address], hereby attest that the following statement is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge and recollection regarding an incident that occurred on [Date] at [Location]."
    *   Body: Chronological account of observations.
    *   Concluding paragraph: "I have read the above statement comprising [number] pages, and I confirm it is an accurate reflection of what I witnessed and stated, and I have had the opportunity to make any corrections."
3.  **Witness Review:** Present the drafted statement to the witness for review. Encourage them to read it carefully.
4.  **Corrections:** Allow the witness to make any necessary corrections, additions, or deletions. All changes should be initialed by the witness.
5.  **Signature:** Witness must sign and date each page of the statement and the final page.
6.  **Adjuster Signature:** The Claims Adjuster/Investigator also signs and dates the statement as the collecting party.

#### 4.4.2 Recorded Audio/Video Statement

1.  **Consent:** Explicit verbal consent for recording must be obtained and recorded at the beginning of the statement.
2.  **Introduction:** State full names of all present, date, time, location, and purpose of the recording.
3.  **Procedure:** Conduct the interview as per Step 4.3.
4.  **Conclusion:** At the end, state: "This concludes the recorded statement of [Witness Name] on [Date] at [Time]."
5.  **Transcription:** Transcribe the recorded statement accurately. The transcription should be made available to the witness for review and signature, if possible.
6.  **Chain of Custody:** Ensure the recording file is securely stored, backed up, and its chain of custody is meticulously documented.

### 4.5 Step 5: Evidence and Documentation

1.  **Witness Contact Information Form:** Complete this form for each witness, including:
    *   Full Legal Name
    *   Current Address
    *   Primary Phone Number
    *   Alternate Phone Number
    *   Email Address
    *   Relationship to incident/parties (if any)
    *   Best time to contact
2.  **Signed Statement:** The original signed written statement (or signed transcription of recorded statement) is critical.
3.  **Photo/Video Consent Form:** If witness provides photos or videos, obtain a signed release form specifying permission for use in the investigation and claim process.
4.  **Chain of Custody Log:** Create or update a log for any physical items or digital media received from the witness.

## 5. Requirements and Criteria

*   All witness statements must be collected by trained personnel.
*   Statements must be objective and reflect the witness's account, not the interviewer's assumptions.
*   Consent to record must be explicit and documented.
*   Witnesses must be given the opportunity to review and correct their statements.
*   Statements must be signed and dated by the witness and the collecting agent.
*   All documentation must be stored securely within the claim file in accordance with company policy and legal requirements.
*   Privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and company data protection policies must be strictly adhered to regarding witness personal information.

## 6. Exceptions

*   **Refusal to Cooperate:** If a witness refuses to provide a statement, document the attempt to contact, the time, date, and reasons for refusal if provided. Do not coerce. Inform management, and legal counsel if necessary.
*   **Unavailability:** If a witness cannot be located or is unavailable (e.g., out of the country, critically ill), document all efforts made to contact them.
*   **Minor Witness:** Statements from minors require parental or guardian consent and their presence during the interview, along with adherence to specific legal guidelines which may vary by jurisdiction. Consult legal counsel.
*   **Language Barrier:** For non-English speaking witnesses, use a certified neutral interpreter. Do not rely on family members or claim parties for interpretation, to avoid potential bias.

## 7. Examples

**Example of a good clarifying question:**
*   **Poor:** "You saw the blue car hit the red car, right?" (Leading)
*   **Good:** "Can you describe the direction of travel for both vehicles immediately before impact?"

**Example of statement conclusion for witness signature:**
"I have read the preceding two (2) pages of this statement and declare that the facts contained herein are true, correct, and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. I understand that this statement may be used for the purpose of investigating the claim related to the incident described. I also confirm that I have been offered the opportunity to make any additions or corrections, and any such changes have been initialed."

***Witness Signature:*** `_________________________`
***Printed Name:*** `_________________________`
***Date:*** `_________________________`
***Time:*** `_________________________`

***Collected by:*** `_________________________`
***Date:*** `_________________________`

## 8. Decision Logic

*   **When to collect a witness statement:** Always if a third party was present or has relevant knowledge, especially if liability is unclear, damages are significant, or conflicting accounts exist.
*   **Method of collection (written vs. recorded):** Written is generally preferred for ease of review and signature. Recorded is suitable if witness prefers it, if time is critical, or for complex narratives. Always offer witness review and signature of transcription for recorded statements.
*   **Proceeding without a witness statement:** Only after all reasonable attempts have been documented as unsuccessful, and with the approval of a Claims Supervisor.

## 9. Evidence/Documentation

All collected witness statements, contact forms, consent forms, and chain-of-custody logs must be uploaded and securely filed within the relevant claim-management system, linked to the specific claim number.

## 10. Timelines

*   **Initial Contact:** Within 24-48 hours of witness identification, if possible, while memories are fresh.
*   **Interview Completion:** Within 5-7 business days of initial contact.
*   **Statement Documentation:** Immediately following the interview, with witness review and signature within 24 hours.
*   **Filing:** Within 1 business day of obtaining the signed statement.
