# SOP: Claim Payment Processing and Release

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the steps and responsibilities for the accurate, secure, and timely processing and release of approved claim payments. The purpose is to ensure all financial disbursements adhere to company policies, regulatory requirements, and established controls, minimizing errors, fraud, and delays. This SOP covers the entire process from final claim approval to payment reconciliation.

## 2. Scope

This SOP applies to all claim payments initiated by the Claims Department and processed by the Finance Department for all lines of business, including but not limited to Auto, Property, and General Liability. It covers payments to policyholders, third-party claimants, vendors (e.g., repair shops, medical providers), and legal counsel.

**Exclusions:** This SOP does not cover the initial claim intake or investigation phases, nor does it cover complex subrogation recoveries or litigation funding, which are addressed in separate SOPs.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Claim ID:** Unique identifier assigned to each claim file.
*   **Payment Request Form (PRF):** Standardized internal document used by the Claims Department to request a payment.
*   **Approval Authority Matrix (AAM):** Document outlining the specific individuals and their respective financial limits for approving claim payments.
*   **ACH:** Automated Clearing House (electronic funds transfer).
*   **EFT:** Electronic Funds Transfer (general term for electronic payment).
*   **Fraud Detection System (FDS):** Automated system used to identify suspicious payment patterns.
*   **Payment Batch:** A group of individual payments processed together.
*   **Remittance Advice:** Document accompanying a payment, detailing what the payment is for.
*   **Sanctions Screening:** Process of checking payee against government sanctions lists (e.g., OFAC).
*   **Service Level Agreement (SLA):** Agreed-upon timeframes for processing payments.

## 4. Main Content: Procedure for Claim Payment Processing and Release

### 4.1. Claim Approval and Payment Request Initiation

1.  **Claim Adjustment:** The assigned Claim Adjuster finalizes the claim investigation and determines the approved payment amount.
2.  **Internal Approval:** The Claim Adjuster routes the claim for internal approval based on the Approval Authority Matrix (AAM).
    *   Payments up to \$5,000: Approved by the Senior Claim Adjuster.
    *   Payments from \$5,001 to \$25,000: Approved by the Claims Team Lead.
    *   Payments from \$25,001 to \$100,000: Approved by the Claims Manager.
    *   Payments from \$250,001 to \$1,000,000: Approved by the Director of Claims (Higher amounts refer to DAL).
3.  **Payment Request Form (PRF) Completion:** Once approved, the Claim Adjuster completes a PRF, ensuring it includes:
    *   Claim ID
    *   Payee Name (legal name, matching W9/W8-BEN if applicable)
    *   Payee Address
    *   Payment Amount (numeric and written)
    *   Payment Method (ACH/EFT, Check, Wire Transfer)
    *   Bank Account Details (for ACH/EFT/Wire - verified via secure portal or direct contact)
    *   Reason for Payment (brief description of loss/service)
    *   Date of Service/Loss
    *   Relevant Policy Number
    *   Supporting Documentation (e.g., invoices, repair estimates, medical bills)
    *   Approver's Signature and Date

### 4.2. Finance Department Review and Verification

1.  **Receipt of PRF:** The Finance Payment Processing team receives the electronic or hard copy PRF and logs it into the payment tracking system.
2.  **Initial Verification (within 4 business hours of receipt):**
    *   Verify PRF completeness and legibility.
    *   Confirm payment amount matches supporting documentation.
    *   Validate approval signatures against the AAM.
    *   Check for duplicate payment requests using Claim ID and payee details.
3.  **Payee Information Cross-Verification:**
    *   Compare payee name and address against the policyholder/claimant record and any W9/W8-BEN forms on file. Any discrepancies require immediate communication with the Claim Adjuster for clarification.
    *   For new payees, initiate collection of W9/W8-BEN forms and perform vendor setup procedures.
4.  **Sanctions Screening:** All payees (individuals and entities) are screened against OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) and other relevant sanctions lists using the designated Sanctions Screening System (e.g., World-Check).
    *   **Result:**
        *   **Clear:** Proceed to next step.
        *   **Potential Match:** Escalate immediately to the Compliance Officer for review. Payment is held pending Compliance clearance.

### 4.3. Fraud Detection and Internal Controls

1.  **Automated Fraud Detection:** All payment requests are automatically scanned by the Fraud Detection System (FDS) for suspicious patterns (e.g., unusual amounts, new payee for old claim, rapid sequence of payments to the same address).
    *   **Result:**
        *   **No Flag:** Proceed to next step.
        *   **Flagged:** The payment request is automatically routed to the Fraud Investigation Unit (FIU) for manual review. Payment is held until cleared by FIU.
2.  **Segregation of Duties:** The individual initiating the PRF (Claim Adjuster) must not be the individual approving the payment in Finance, nor the individual releasing the payment.

### 4.4. Payment Execution

1.  **Payment Batch Creation:** Approved and verified PRFs are grouped into daily payment batches by payment method (ACH, Check, Wire).
2.  **Payment System Entry:** Data from the PRFs is entered into the company's financial management system (e.g., SAP, Oracle Financials) for payment processing.
    *   **For ACH/EFT:** Bank details are securely transmitted.
    *   **For Checks:** Checks are automatically generated, including remittance advice.
    *   **For Wire Transfers:** Manual verification of wire instructions by a second Finance team member is required before initiation.
3.  **Final Authorization:** A designated Finance Manager or Director provides final authorization within the financial management system for the payment batch. This step acts as a final review of the batch for accuracy and completeness.
4.  **Payment Transmission:**
    *   **ACH/EFT:** Batches are transmitted to the bank for processing daily by 3:00 PM EST.
    *   **Checks:** Checks are printed, matched with remittance advice, folded, and mailed daily by 4:00 PM EST.
    *   **Wire Transfers:** Initiated individually through the banking portal upon receiving final authorization.
5.  **Remittance Advice Distribution:** For ACH/EFT payments, an electronic remittance advice is sent to the payee's registered email address on the day of payment transmission.

### 4.5. Reconciliation and Documentation

1.  **Daily Reconciliation:** The Finance Payment Processing team performs daily reconciliation of released payments against the payment tracking system and bank statements.
2.  **Investigate Discrepancies:** Any discrepancies, such as failed payments, incorrect amounts, or missed payments, are immediately investigated. The Claim Adjuster and payee are notified, and corrective action is initiated.
3.  **Record Keeping:** All PRFs, supporting documentation, approvals, and reconciliation records are maintained electronically in the central records management system for a minimum of 7 years, in accordance with regulatory requirements.

## 5. Requirements and Criteria

*   **Accuracy:** All payment details must be 100% accurate as per the approved PRF.
*   **Authorization:** All payments must have appropriate approvals as per the AAM.
*   **Compliance:** All payments must comply with internal policies, state/federal regulations, and sanctions laws.
*   **Documentation:** Complete supporting documentation is required for every payment.
*   **Timeliness:** Payments must be processed and released within the established SLAs.

## 6. Timelines (Service Level Agreements - SLAs)

*   **Claim Department Approval:** Within 2 business days of final claim adjustment.
*   **Finance Department Initial Verification:** Within 1 business day of receiving a complete PRF.
*   **Sanctions/Fraud Screening:** Real-time upon submission; resolution of flags within 2 business days.
*   **Payment Execution (from Finance Approval):**
    *   ACH/EFT: Same day if approved by 2:00 PM EST, otherwise next business day.
    *   Checks: Mailed within 1 business day.
    *   Wire Transfers: Executed within 4 business hours of final authorization.
*   **Reconciliation of Daily Batch:** Within 1 business day of payment transmission.

## 7. Exceptions

*   **Urgent Payments (Expedited):** Payments requiring release faster than standard SLAs (e.g., life-threatening medical emergency). Requires explicit approval from a Director-level manager or higher and clear justification on the PRF. These are processed as "manual wires" or "priority ACH" and tracked separately.
*   **International Payments:** Subject to additional compliance checks, currency conversion rates, and bank fees. Requires explicit approval from the Finance Director.
*   **Payment Reversals/Cancellations:** Requires a "Payment Stop/Cancel Request" form, approved by a Finance Team Lead. Investigation into the reason for reversal is mandatory.
*   **System Outages:** In the event of a critical system outage preventing electronic payment processing, a defined manual emergency payment procedure will be activated, requiring a higher level of manual review and dual authorization. This procedure is detailed in the "Emergency Payment Processing Protocol" document.

## 8. Evidence and Documentation

*   Approved Payment Request Forms (PRFs) and all attached supporting documents (invoices, estimates, medical records, etc.)
*   Electronic audit trails of all approvals (Claim and Finance).
*   Sanctions Screening results.
*   Fraud Detection System (FDS) reports.
*   Bank transmission confirmations and reconciliation reports.
*   W9/W8-BEN forms for payees.
*   Correspondence related to payment discrepancies or exceptions.
