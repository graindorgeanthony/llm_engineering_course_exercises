# Standard Operating Procedure: Life Claim Verification and Payout

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the standardized process for the verification, assessment, and disbursal of payouts for all life insurance claims submitted to [Insurance Company Name]. The purpose of this SOP is to ensure consistent, accurate, and timely processing of life claims, proper identification of beneficiaries, compliance with regulatory requirements, and reduction of fraud, ultimately leading to efficient and empathetic service delivery to our policyholders and their beneficiaries.

## 2. Scope

This SOP applies to all life insurance claims, including individual and group life policies, submitted after the effective date. It covers all stages from initial claim receipt and documentation review through beneficiary verification, final decision-making, and payment disbursal.

### 2.1. Inclusions:
*   Death claims for policyholders.
*   Claims involving accidental death benefits.
*   Claims involving terminal illness riders, if applicable.
*   Payouts to designated primary and contingent beneficiaries.

### 2.2. Exclusions:
*   Disability claims (covered under a separate SOP: `procedures/disability-claim-processing-sop.md`).
*   Annuity payouts (covered under a separate SOP: `procedures/annuity-disbursement-guidelines.md`).
*   Claims for policies under the contestability period that require intensive fraud investigation (these are escalated to the Fraud Investigation Unit (FIU) after initial review).

## 3. Definitions

*   **Claimant:** The individual or entity submitting the claim, typically the beneficiary or their legal representative.
*   **Beneficiary:** The person(s) or entity legally designated by the policyholder to receive the policy proceeds upon the policyholder's death.
*   **Policyholder:** The individual insured under the life insurance policy.
*   **Proof of Death (POD):** Official documentation confirming the death of the policyholder (e.g., death certificate).
*   **Contestability Period:** A specific period, typically 1 or 2 years from the policy's issue date, during which the insurer can void the policy for material misrepresentation on the application.
*   **AML/CTF:** Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing.
*   **Claim Analyst:** The dedicated team member responsible for processing and adjudicating life claims.
*   **Lead Claim Analyst:** Senior claim analyst responsible for reviewing complex cases and approving payouts above a certain threshold.

## 4. Main Content: Life Claim Verification and Payout Process

The following steps outline the procedure for handling life insurance claims:

### 4.1. Claim Intake and Initial Review (Claim Analyst)

1.  **Receipt of Claim:**
    *   Claims are received via postal mail, email, or directly through the online claims portal.
    *   All received claims are logged into the Claims Management System (CMS) within 24 business hours of receipt.
    *   Assign a unique Claim ID and associate with the relevant policy number.

2.  **Basic Documentation Check:**
    *   Verify submission of a completed Life Insurance Claim Form (Form LC-1A).
    *   Confirm presence of an official Death Certificate (certified copy preferred, but legible photocopy initially acceptable pending verification).
    *   Check for identity proof of the claimant/beneficiary (e.g., driver's license, passport).
    *   Verify relationship documentation between the claimant and the deceased (e.g., marriage certificate, birth certificate, legal adoption papers, divorce decree if relevant).

3.  **Policy Status Review:**
    *   Retrieve policy details from the Policy Administration System (PAS).
    *   Confirm policy was in force at the time of death (premium payments up-to-date, no lapse).
    *   Check for any outstanding loans or assignments against the policy.
    *   Note if the policy is within the `Contestability Period` (first 2 years from issue date).

### 4.2. Detailed Verification (Claim Analyst)

1.  **Death Certificate Verification:**
    *   If a photocopy was submitted, request a certified original death certificate within 5 business days if not already provided.
    *   Verify the cause of death against policy exclusions (e.g., suicide within contestability period, illegal acts).
    *   Cross-reference date of death with policy in-force status.

2.  **Beneficiary Identification and Verification:**
    *   Compare claimant details with policy's designated beneficiary records in PAS.
    *   **Primary Beneficiary:** If listed, verify identity documents match the claimant.
    *   **Contingent Beneficiary:** If primary beneficiary is deceased or cannot be located, proceed with the contingent beneficiary.
    *   **Multiple Beneficiaries:** Confirm allocation percentages and verify all listed beneficiaries.
    *   **Minor Beneficiary:** If the beneficiary is a minor, obtain documentation of legal guardianship or a court order for establishment of a trust/custodial account for the minor. Payouts to minors require specific legal handling (refer to Legal Department guidelines).
    *   **Estate as Beneficiary:** If the estate is the beneficiary, require Letters Testamentary or Letters of Administration naming the executor/administrator. Payout will be made to the estate.
    *   **Trust as Beneficiary:** Require a copy of the Trust Agreement to identify the trustee(s) and confirm the trust's validity. Payout will be made directly to the trust.
    *   **Missing or Ambiguous Beneficiary:** If beneficiary information is incomplete or disputed, escalate to the Lead Claim Analyst for legal guidance. This may require an interpleader action.

3.  **Medical Information Review (if required):**
    *   If the death occurred within the `Contestability Period` and the cause of death is inconsistent with policy application information (e.g., undeclared pre-existing condition), request authorization from the claimant to obtain medical records of the deceased.
    *   Consult with the Medical Underwriting team for assessment of medical records against the original application.

4.  **Premium Payment History Audit:**
    *   Confirm all premiums due up to the date of death were paid.
    *   Calculate any arrears or underpayments. These will be deducted from the payout.

5.  **AML/CTF Check:**
    *   Perform a standard AML/CTF check on all beneficiaries receiving payouts over $10,000 using approved compliance tools (e.g., World-Check One).
    *   Flag any suspicious findings and escalate immediately to the Compliance Officer.
    *   For payouts over $50,000, a enhanced due diligence (EDD) review must be conducted.

### 4.3. Claim Adjudication and Decision (Claim Analyst, Lead Claim Analyst)

1.  **Benefit Calculation:**
    *   Confirm the sum assured based on the policy schedule.
    *   Add any riders (e.g., Accidental Death Benefit, Terminal Illness Benefit).
    *   Deduct any outstanding policy loans, unpaid premiums, or other policy indebtedness.
    *   Calculate final net benefit amount.

2.  **Recommendation and Documentation:**
    *   Prepare a detailed claim summary outlining findings, verification steps, benefit calculation, and a recommendation for approval or denial.
    *   Ensure all supporting documents are scanned and attached to the CMS record.

3.  **Approval Thresholds:**
    *   **Claim Analyst:** Can approve payouts up to $100,000.
    *   **Lead Claim Analyst:** Can approve payouts between $100,001 and $500,000.
    *   **Claims Committee:** Required for payouts exceeding $500,000, or for any denial of claim, or cases involving suspected fraud or legal disputes. The Claims Committee meets weekly to review such cases.

4.  **Final Decision:**
    *   Upon approval, generate an official approval letter to the claimant.
    *   For denials, generate a comprehensive denial letter clearly stating the reasons for denial, referencing specific policy provisions, and providing information on the appeal process. All denial letters must be reviewed and approved by the Lead Claim Analyst and Legal Counsel.

### 4.4. Payout Disbursal (Claim Analyst, Finance Department)

1.  **Payment Processing:**
    *   Submit approved claim for payment processing to the Finance Department within 2 business days of final approval.
    *   Specify payment method: direct deposit (preferred), check, or wire transfer (for international beneficiaries, subject to additional checks).
    *   For direct deposits, obtain verified bank account details from the beneficiary.
    *   For checks, confirm mailing address.

2.  **Communication:**
    *   Notify the beneficiary of the payment status, expected disbursal date, and method.
    *   Provide direct contact details for any payment-related inquiries.

3.  **Record Keeping:**
    *   Update the CMS with the payment date and amount.
    *   Archive all claim documentation in accordance with retention policies (typically 7 years electronically).

## 5. Requirements/Criteria

*   **Timeliness:** All claims must be acknowledged within 3 business days of receipt. Initial review completed within 5 business days. Payout must be disbursed within 10 business days of final approval, provided all necessary banking details are received.
*   **Documentation:** All claims require a certified Death Certificate, clear proof of identity for the claimant, and documented relationship to the deceased.
*   **Policy in Force:** The policy must have been active and all premiums paid up to the date of death.
*   **Beneficiary Validation:** Beneficiary identity and legal entitlement must be unequivocally established.

## 6. Exceptions

*   **Contestability Period Claims:** Claims falling within the contestability period that suggest misrepresentation will automatically be escalated to the Lead Claim Analyst for further investigation, including potential medical record retrieval and consultation with the Legal Department. The standard processing timeline may be extended by up to 30 additional business days for these cases.
*   **Missing or Disputed Beneficiary:** If beneficiaries are unclear, missing, or there are competing claims, the claim will be escalated to the Legal Department. Processing will be paused until a legal resolution or court order is obtained.
*   **Suspicion of Fraud:** Any claim with red flags for fraud (e.g., suspicious death certificate, inconsistent details, complex beneficiary changes just prior to death) must be immediately escalated to the Fraud Investigation Unit (FIU) manager. All claim processing will be halted pending FIU review.
