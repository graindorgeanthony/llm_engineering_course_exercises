# SOP: Special Investigation Unit (SIU) Referral Procedure

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the process for identifying, documenting, and referring claims that exhibit characteristics indicative of potential fraud, abuse, or other suspicious activity to the Special Investigation Unit (SIU). The purpose is to ensure timely and effective escalation of such claims, protect the company from financial losses due to fraudulent activities, maintain claims integrity, and comply with all applicable regulatory requirements.

## 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all Claims Adjusters, Claims Processors, and Claims Supervisors across all lines of business (e.g., auto, property, liability, workers' compensation) within [Company Name]. It covers the initial identification of suspicious indicators, documentation requirements, the referral submission process, and subsequent SIU interaction. This SOP does not cover the internal investigation procedures of the SIU itself, only the process for referring claims *to* the SIU.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Special Investigation Unit (SIU):** A specialized department responsible for investigating claims with potential fraud, misrepresentation, or other suspicious circumstances.
*   **Suspicious Activity Report (SAR):** A standardized internal form used to document and initiate a referral to the SIU.
*   **Red Flags:** Indicators or circumstances that, either individually or in combination, suggest the possibility of fraudulent activity, misrepresentation, or abuse related to a claim.
*   **Claims Adjuster/Processor:** The individual primarily responsible for handling and evaluating a claim.
*   **Claim Supervisor:** The direct manager of the Claims Adjuster/Processor, responsible for oversight and approval of SIU referrals.

## 4. SIU Referral Criteria (Red Flags)

A claim should be considered for SIU referral if one or more of the following "red flags" are identified, especially when multiple indicators are present:

### 4.1. Claimant/Policyholder Behavior
*   Unusual urgency for payment or settlement.
*   Lack of cooperation or evasiveness regarding claim details, documentation, or interviews.
*   Coaching of witnesses or inconsistent statements among involved parties.
*   Inability to provide contact information or frequent changes of address/phone number.
*   History of frequent or similar claims with different insurers or properties.
*   Refusal to provide sworn statements or participate in examinations under oath (EUO).

### 4.2. Incident Details
*   Incident details that are implausible, exaggerated, or defy logic/physics (e.g., property damage inconsistent with reported cause).
*   Conflicting accounts from witnesses, police reports, or other official documents.
*   Loss occurring shortly after policy inception or significant policy changes.
*   Sudden disappearance of items with high sentimental value but low market value.
*   Multiple parties residing at the same address involved in separate, seemingly unrelated incidents.

### 4.3. Documentation and Evidence
*   Altered, forged, or suspicious documents (e.g., medical bills, repair estimates, purchase receipts, police reports).
*   Missing or incomplete documentation that is typically required.
*   Medical treatment disproportionate to the reported injury/damage.
*   Repair estimates from unknown or unlisted vendors, or estimates that appear inflated.
*   Use of duplicate or generic photographs for evidence.
*   Inconsistent dates or timestamps on digital evidence.

### 4.4. Third-Party Involvement
*   Suspicious medical providers, clinics, repair shops, or legal counsel known for previous fraudulent activities.
*   Coordinated claims involving multiple individuals or entities (e.g., claimant, provider, attorney).
*   Providers billing for services not rendered or excessive/unnecessary treatment.

### 4.5. Financial Indicators
*   Suspicious financial transactions related to the claim.
*   Questionable ownership or insurable interest.
*   Discrepancies in declared values versus actual value of lost/damaged property.

## 5. Procedure for SIU Referral

The SIU referral process consists of five main steps: Identification, Documentation, Review, Submission, and Follow-up.

### 5.1. Step 1: Identification of Red Flags
1.  **Claims Adjuster/Processor Responsibility:** Continuously evaluate all claims for potential red flags as outlined in Section 4 during the normal course of claims handling.
2.  **Initial Assessment:** If one or more red flags are identified, the Claims Adjuster/Processor must pause routine claims processing and initiate a preliminary review.

### 5.2. Step 2: Documentation and Preliminary Case Building
1.  **Gather Evidence:** Collect all relevant claim documentation that supports the suspicion (e.g., conflicting statements, suspicious invoices, police reports, photographs, policy history).
2.  **Draft Suspicious Activity Report (SAR):** Complete the internal SAR form located in the Shared Drive (path: `[Company Network Path]\Claims\SIU_Referral\SAR_Form_v2.1.docx`).
    *   **Section A: Claim Details:** Policy number, claim number, claimant name, date of loss, type of loss.
    *   **Section B: Red Flags Identified:** Clearly list each specific red flag observed and reference the supporting evidence.
    *   **Section C: Narrative Summary:** Provide a concise, factual summary of the claim and why it is suspicious. Avoid conjecture. Include details such as:
        *   What happened (based on claimant/policyholder statement).
        *   What evidence contradicts or makes the statement suspicious.
        *   Any unusual or unexplained circumstances.
        *   Any parties involved (e.g., doctors, body shops, attorneys) that raise concern.
    *   **Section D: Actions Taken by Adjuster:** Detail any actions already taken.
    *   **Section E: Requested SIU Actions:** Suggest specific areas for SIU investigation, if applicable (e.g., "Request scene investigation," "Verify medical provider credentials").
3.  **Organize Supporting Documents:** Compile copies of all documents referenced in the SAR into a single, clearly labeled electronic folder or PDF package.

### 5.3. Step 3: Supervisor Review and Approval
1.  **Submit to Supervisor:** The completed SAR form and supporting documentation must be submitted electronically to the immediate Claims Supervisor via email with the subject line: `SIU Referral Request - [Claim Number] - [Claimant Name]`.
2.  **Supervisor Review:** The Claims Supervisor will review the SAR and supporting evidence within **48 business hours** of submission.
    *   The Supervisor will evaluate if the identified red flags meet the criteria for an SIU referral based on this SOP and departmental guidelines.
    *   The Supervisor may request additional clarification or documentation from the Claims Adjuster/Processor.
3.  **Approval/Rejection:**
    *   **Approved:** If approved, the Supervisor will sign (electronically) the SAR and provide their approval in reply email.
    *   **Rejected:** If rejected, the Supervisor will provide clear reasons for rejection and any alternative instructions (e.g., "Proceed with standard claims handling," "Investigate X further before resubmitting"). The Adjuster must document the rejection and rationale in the claim file.

### 5.4. Step 4: SIU Submission
1.  **Approved SAR Submission:** Once approved by the Supervisor, the Claims Adjuster/Processor will email the final SAR form and all supporting documentation to the dedicated SIU referral inbox: `SIUReferrals@[companyname].com`.
2.  **Claim System Update:** Immediately after sending the referral email, the Claims Adjuster/Processor must:
    *   Add a detailed note to the claim file in the Claims Management System (CMS) indicating "SIU Referral Submitted on [Date/Time] by [Adjuster Name] with Supervisor [Supervisor Name] Approval."
    *   Change the claim status in the CMS to "Pending SIU Review" or "SIU Referred."
    *   All further outbound communication related to the claim (e.g., payments, denials, information requests to claimant) must be halted without express SIU instruction.

### 5.5. Step 5: SIU Acknowledgment and Follow-up
1.  **SIU Acknowledgment:** The SIU department will acknowledge receipt of the referral via email within **24 business hours**. This acknowledgment will include an SIU Case Number.
2.  **Initial Contact:** An SIU Investigator will contact the referring Claims Adjuster/Processor within **3 business days** to discuss the referral and gather any additional information.
3.  **Ongoing Communication:** The Claims Adjuster/Processor will serve as the primary point of contact for the SIU regarding the referred claim. All requests for information from the SIU must be addressed promptly.
4.  **Claim Resolution/Disposition:** The SIU will notify the Claims Adjuster/Processor upon conclusion of their investigation, providing recommendations for claim disposition (e.g., deny, pay, continue investigation, negotiate settlement). The Adjuster will then update the CMS accordingly.

## 6. Exceptions

*   **Imminent Threat/Risk:** In cases where there is an imminent threat of significant financial loss, legal action, or physical harm, the Claims Adjuster/Processor should immediately contact their Supervisor verbally and then the SIU Director directly (phone: [SIU Director Phone Number]) before following the formal email submission process. Formal documentation (SAR) is still required within 24 hours.
*   **Urgent Referrals:** If a referral requires immediate attention outside of standard business hours, the Claims Adjuster/Processor should use the emergency contact procedure outlined by their Supervisor and then follow up with the standard email process on the next business day.

## 7. Evidence/Documentation

All supporting documentation must be retained in the electronic claim file and/or the SIU referral folder. This includes:
*   Completed and Supervisor-approved SAR form.
*   All claim-related correspondence (emails, letters).
*   Statements (recorded, written).
*   Police reports, fire reports, incident reports.
*   Medical records, bills, treatment plans.
*   Repair estimates, appraisal reports.
*   Photographs, videos.
*   Policy documents.
*   Any internal or external investigative reports.

## 8. Timelines

*   **Supervisor Review:** Within 48 business hours of Adjuster submission.
*   **SIU Acknowledgement:** Within 24 business hours of SIU referral email.
*   **SIU Initial Contact:** Within 3 business days of referral acknowledgment.
*   **Response to SIU Inquiries:** Within 24 business hours (unless otherwise specified by SIU).
