# SOP: Remote Claims Assessment Tools

## 1. Overview

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the process for leveraging remote claims assessment tools, including virtual inspections, telematics data, and drone inspections, to efficiently evaluate damage, verify claim details, and expedite claims processing. Utilizing these tools enhances accuracy, reduces physical site visits, and improves policyholder experience.

## 2. Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide a standardized guide for claims adjusters and processors on when and how to effectively integrate remote assessment technologies into the claims lifecycle for Property, Auto, and Specialty claims.

## 3. Scope

This SOP applies to all claims personnel involved in the assessment and adjudication of claims where remote assessment tools are deemed appropriate and available, as determined by claim type, damage severity, and policyholder consent.

**Included:**
*   Initial claim triage for remote assessment suitability.
*   Coordination with policyholders for virtual inspections.
*   Acquisition and analysis of telematics data for auto claims.
*   Deployment and data acquisition from drone inspections for property claims.
*   Integration of remote data into claim documentation and decision-making.

**Excluded:**
*   Claims requiring physical presence due to regulatory requirements (e.g., certain severe injury claims).
*   Claims where remote assessment is technically infeasible (e.g., no network connectivity, complex concealed damage).
*   Catastrophic event (CAT) claims that require immediate on-site response teams, unless specifically approved by CAT leadership for supplemental remote methods.

## 4. Definitions

*   **Virtual Inspection:** An assessment conducted remotely via live video feed, recorded video, or photos provided by the policyholder or a local third party (e.g., contractor), guided by an adjuster.
*   **Telematics Data:** Information collected from a vehicle's onboard systems, such as GPS location, speed, braking patterns, and impact data, often used in auto insurance claims.
*   **Drone Inspection:** Aerial imagery and video capture using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to assess damage, typically for property roofs, large structures, or inaccessible areas.
*   **Remote Assessment Platform (RAP):** The designated software system(s) used for scheduling, conducting, and storing data from virtual and drone inspections (e.g., ClaimView 360, DroneDox).
*   **Consent:** Explicit permission obtained from the policyholder to utilize remote assessment tools and collect associated data.

## 5. Main Content: Remote Assessment Workflow

### 5.1 Initial Claim Triage for Remote Suitability

Upon claim registration, the Claims Intake Specialist or initial Adjuster screens the claim for remote assessment suitability using the criteria below.

#### 5.1.1 Decision Logic: Remote Assessment Suitability

| Claim Characteristic | Auto Claim | Property Claim | Specialty Claim | Decision |
| :------------------- | :--------- | :------------- | :-------------- | :------- |
| **Damage Severity**  | Minor to Moderate (body panel damage, windshield, interior) | Cosmetic to Moderate (roof shingle damage, fence, interior water stain, small fire damage) | Dependent on claim type and impact (e.g., minor equipment damage) | **Eligible** |
|                      | Catastrophic, structural, major mechanical | Structural, foundation, extensive hidden damage | Major structural, high-value art, complex machinery | **Not Eligible (Requires Physical)** |
| **Policyholder Willingness** | Expresses comfort with technology, has smartphone/device | Expresses comfort with technology, has smartphone/device | Expresses comfort with technology, has smartphone/device | **Eligible** |
| **Data Availability** | Telematics data available via policy or consent | Aerial imagery available, clear line of sight for drone | Specific digital evidence (e.g., CCTV) available | **Eligible** |
| **Claim Complexity** | Single vehicle, straightforward liability | Single-family home, clear property lines, accessible areas | Simple property damage, discrete incident | **Eligible** |
|                      | Multi-vehicle, complex liability, multiple injuries | Commercial property, multi-unit dwelling, environmental hazards | High-value, complex liability, specialized expertise | **Not Eligible (Requires Physical or Specialist)** |

### 5.2 Obtaining Policyholder Consent

Before any remote assessment, explicit consent must be obtained from the policyholder.

#### 5.2.1 Procedure for Obtaining Consent

1.  **Inform Policyholder:** Adjuster explains the benefits of remote assessment (faster processing, convenience) and the process (e.g., video call, sharing photos).
2.  **Highlight Data Usage:** Clearly state what data will be collected, how it will be used (e.g., damage assessment, fraud detection), and how it will be stored.
3.  **Offer Alternatives:** Inform the policyholder of the option for a traditional in-person inspection if they are uncomfortable with remote tools.
4.  **Document Consent:** Record policyholder's verbal or written consent in the claim file (CRM system). For virtual inspections, system typically records explicit consent at the start of the session. For telematics, consent is typically secured at policy inception but must be re-confirmed for claim use.

### 5.3 Virtual Inspection Process (for Auto & Property)

#### 5.3.1 Scheduling and Preparation

1.  **Selection of Tool:** Adjuster selects the appropriate RAP module (e.g., ClaimView 360 virtual session).
2.  **Scheduling:** Adjuster coordinates a convenient time with the policyholder. System generates and sends an invitation link via SMS or email.
3.  **Policyholder Instructions:** Provide clear pre-inspection instructions (e.g., fully charge phone, ensure good lighting, clear items from area, have vehicle in well-lit area).

#### 5.3.2 Conducting the Virtual Inspection

1.  **Connection:** Adjuster initiates the virtual call at the scheduled time. Policyholder joins via the provided link.
2.  **Guidance:** Adjuster verbally guides the policyholder to show specific areas of damage, using the device camera.
3.  **Photo/Video Capture:** Adjuster uses the RAP's integrated features to capture high-resolution photos and video evidence. Annotations can be added in real-time.
4.  **Documentation:** All captured media is automatically stored in the claim file within the RAP, timestamped and geo-tagged where possible.
5.  **Quality Check:** Adjuster ensures sufficient detail and clarity for assessment. If not, request additional photos/video or re-schedule.

### 5.4 Telematics Data Acquisition and Analysis (for Auto)

#### 5.4.1 Acquisition

1.  **Verify Consent:** Confirm policyholder consent for telematics data usage (typically part of policy terms for specific programs).
2.  **Request Data:** If not automatically integrated, Adjuster requests relevant data from the telematics provider (e.g., LexisNexis Telematics Exchange, Verisk, Octo Telematics).
3.  **Data Scope:** Request specific data points relevant to the incident: speed at impact, braking, g-force, first point of impact, GPS coordinates, route leading up to incident for the 72 hours prior to loss.

#### 5.4.2 Analysis

1.  **Data Review:** Claims Analyst or Adjuster reviews telematics reports within the designated analytics platform.
2.  **Correlation with Claim:** Correlate telematics data with the policyholder's statement of loss, police report, and damage assessment.
3.  **Anomaly Detection:** Identify any discrepancies between reported events and telematics data that may warrant further investigation (e.g., speed exceeding limit at impact location, inconsistencies in impact direction).
4.  **Documentation:** Summarize findings and attach reports to the claim file.

### 5.5 Drone Inspection Process (for Property)

#### 5.5.1 Deployment Criteria

*   Roof damage assessment for multi-story properties.
*   Access issues (steep slope, unsafe conditions, dense vegetation).
*   Large property structures (e.g., commercial buildings, large agricultural barns).
*   Post-disaster assessment for wide-area impact.

#### 5.5.2 Procedure

1.  **Vendor Engagement:** Adjuster initiates a request for drone inspection services through approved vendor list (e.g., DroneDeploy, Kespry, EagleView).
2.  **Information Provided:** Provide claim number, property address, specific areas of interest, and policyholder contact for access coordination.
3.  **Flight Execution:** Approved vendor schedules and executes the drone flight, adhering to all FAA regulations and local airspace restrictions.
4.  **Data Delivery:** Vendor uploads high-resolution imagery, 3D models, and damage reports to the RAP or a shared secure portal.
5.  **Review and Analysis:** Property Adjuster reviews drone data, identifying and annotating damage, measuring dimensions, and generating estimates.
6.  **Documentation:** Attach all drone reports, imagery, and 3D models to the claim file.

## 6. Requirements and Criteria

*   **Technology:** Policyholders must have access to a smartphone/tablet with a working camera and stable internet connection for virtual inspections.
*   **Consent:** Explicit policyholder consent is mandatory for all remote assessment activities.
*   **Training:** All adjusters utilizing remote assessment tools must complete certified training modules for each platform.
*   **Security:** All remote assessment platforms and data transmission methods must adhere to the company's data security and privacy policies (e.g., HIPAA compliance for injury claims, PCI-DSS for payment info).
*   **Data Integrity:** All collected data must be geo-tagged, timestamped, and stored securely in the claim file without alteration.

## 7. Exceptions

*   **Policyholder Refusal:** If a policyholder refuses remote assessment, a traditional on-site inspection must be arranged.
*   **Insufficient Data:** If remote tools cannot gather sufficient detail for a comprehensive assessment, an escalation to a physical inspection is required.
*   **Technical Issues:** In case of persistent technical difficulties (e.g., poor connectivity, device failure), pivot to an alternative method or schedule a physical inspection.
*   **Fraud Indicators:** If during remote assessment, fraud indicators are identified, halt the remote process and escalate to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) for further investigation, which may involve a physical inspection.

## 8. Examples

### Example 1: Auto Claim - Minor Collision (Virtual Inspection)

**Claim:** FNOL for a rear-end collision, minor bumper damage reported.
**Assessment:** Adjuster offers a virtual inspection. Policyholder agrees and uses their smartphone to show the bumper, taillight, and trunk alignment. Adjuster captures photos and measurements using the RAP.
**Outcome:** Damage estimated at $1,200, within virtual assessment thresholds. No physical inspection needed, greatly reducing cycle time to 2 days.

### Example 2: Property Claim - Roof Damage (Drone Inspection)

**Claim:** Hailstorm damage reported on a two-story residential roof. Access is steep and potentially hazardous.
**Assessment:** Adjuster requests a drone inspection. An approved vendor deploys a drone, capturing high-resolution photos and a 3D model of the roof.
**Outcome:** Drone imagery clearly shows widespread hail damage, allowing for precise lineal foot measurements and shingle count. Estimate generated and approved without an adjuster physically climbing the roof, reducing safety risks and assessment time.

### Example 3: Auto Claim - Unclear Liability (Telematics Data)

**Claim:** Policyholder states another driver veered into their lane, causing impact. Other driver denies.
**Assessment:** Policyholder enrolled in a telematics program. Adjuster obtains telematics data for the minutes leading up to the incident.
**Outcome:** Telematics data shows sharp steering input and sudden deceleration directly correlating to the policyholder's reported location and time of collision, supporting the policyholder's narrative and clarifying liability.

## 9. Decision Logic: Escalation to Physical Inspection

Automated triggers or adjuster discretion will flag claims for potential escalation:

*   Remote assessment yields insufficient visual detail (e.g., blurry photos, inaccessible areas).
*   Damage appears to be structural or exceeds pre-defined cost thresholds for remote assessment (e.g., auto repair >$5,000, property repair >$25,000).
*   Policyholder expresses discomfort or inability to cooperate with remote tools.
*   Discrepancies arise between policyholder statement and remote evidence.
*   Complex liability disputes requiring on-site evidence collection.
*   Suspected fraud or material misrepresentation.

## 10. Evidence/Documentation

All remote assessment data must be linked directly to the claim file:
*   Virtual inspection session recordings, photos, and chat logs.
*   Telematics reports and raw data files.
*   Drone imagery, 3D models, and damage reports.
*   Policyholder consent forms or documented verbal consent.
*   Adjuster notes detailing the remote assessment process, findings, and decisions.

## 11. Timelines

*   **Virtual Inspection Scheduling:** Within 24 business hours of policyholder consent.
*   **Telematics Data Acquisition:** Within 48 hours of request initiation, pending provider response time.
*   **Drone Inspection Deployment:** Within 3-5 business days of request initiation, pending vendor availability and weather conditions.
*   **Remote Data Review:** Within 1 business day of data receipt.
*   **Claim Adjustment from Remote Assessment:** Target 5 business days from data receipt to estimate completion.
