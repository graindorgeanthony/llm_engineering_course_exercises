# SOP: Lienholder Payoff Procedures (Total Loss)

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the step-by-step process for managing and executing lienholder payoffs in total loss vehicle claims. The primary purpose is to ensure accurate, timely, and compliant disbursement of funds to lienholders, facilitate the transfer of vehicle title, and finalize the total loss claim efficiently. Adherence to this procedure minimizes errors, reduces delays, and ensures compliance with regulatory requirements and internal policies.

## 2. Scope

This SOP applies to all claims adjusters, total loss unit specialists, and claims processing personnel involved in vehicle total loss claims where a lienholder is identified on the vehicle title. It covers the entire process from initial lienholder identification to final payoff and title release.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Lienholder:** A financial institution or other entity that holds a security interest in the insured vehicle as collateral for a loan. They are legally entitled to receive the outstanding loan balance upon the total loss of the vehicle.
*   **Total Loss:** A condition where the cost to repair a damaged vehicle exceeds a certain percentage (e.g., 75%, specific state thresholds) of its Actual Cash Value (ACV) or when state regulations mandate a total loss declaration due to severe damage.
*   **Actual Cash Value (ACV):** The fair market value of the vehicle immediately before the loss, considering factors like age, mileage, condition, and options.
*   **Settlement Offer:** The amount offered to the insured and/or lienholder for the total loss of the vehicle, typically based on the ACV.
*   **Payoff Quote/Statement:** A formal document from the lienholder detailing the exact outstanding balance on the vehicle loan, valid for a specific period.
*   **Title Release:** The official document or process by which the lienholder signifies that the loan has been paid in full and their interest in the vehicle has been satisfied, allowing for transfer of ownership.
*   **Salvage Certificate/Title:** A type of ownership document issued for a vehicle declared a total loss, indicating its damaged status.

## 4. Procedure for Lienholder Payoff

The following steps detail the process for handling total loss claims with identified lienholders:

### 4.1. Lienholder Identification and Verification

1.  **Initial Claim Review:** Upon declaration of a total loss, the assigned claims adjuster verifies if a lienholder is listed on the vehicle's registration or title documentation provided by the insured.
2.  **System Check:** Cross-reference information in the claim system (e.g., "Vehicle Information" screen, "Lienholder Details" section) and MVR (Motor Vehicle Records) searches.
3.  **Insured Confirmation:** Contact the insured party to confirm the lienholder's name, primary contact number, and account or loan number. Document this confirmation in the claim file notes.
4.  **Discrepancy Resolution:** If discrepancies arise between documentation and insured statements, prioritize official documents (title, MVR). If further clarification is needed, contact the insured and/or the suspected lienholder.

### 4.2. Requesting Lienholder Payoff Quote

1.  **Communication Method:**
    *   **Preferred:** Lienholder portal or online system (if available and secure).
    *   **Alternative 1:** Fax a formal request including insured's name, vehicle year/make/model/VIN, and loan account number.
    *   **Alternative 2:** Call the lienholder's dedicated total loss/insurance payoff department. Always request a written payoff statement regardless of a verbal quote.
2.  **Information Required:** The request for a payoff quote must include:
    *   Date of total loss (Date of Loss - DOL).
    *   Our company's claim number.
    *   Insured's full name.
    *   Vehicle VIN (Vehicle Identification Number).
    *   Loan account number.
    *   Request for a **15-day or 30-day payoff quote**, specifying the validity date.
    *   Instructions for where to send the payoff statement (fax number, email, or physical address).
3.  **Follow-up:** If a payoff statement is not received within 3 business days of the initial request, follow up with the lienholder. Document all communication attempts in the claim file.

### 4.3. Review and Approval of Payoff Quote

1.  **Receipt and Verification:** Upon receiving the payoff quote, verify that it matches the vehicle details and loan account number.
2.  **Outstanding Balance:** Note the exact payoff amount and the valid-until date.
3.  **Discrepancy Resolution (Payoff Amount):** If the payoff quoted seems excessively high or does not align with the insured's reported balance, contact the lienholder for clarification. If a discrepancy persists, escalate to a Total Loss Unit lead.
4.  **Total Loss Settlement Calculation:** Calculate the total loss settlement amount based on the ACV, less any applicable deductibles and prior lienholder payments (if any).
5.  **Comparison:** Compare the lienholder payoff amount to the total loss settlement amount.

### 4.4. Payment Processing and Disbursement

#### 4.4.1. Scenario 1: Total Loss Settlement ≥ Lienholder Payoff

1.  **Payoff Approval:** Approve the lienholder payoff amount for processing.
2.  **Payment Generation:** Initiate payment to the lienholder for the *exact outstanding balance* as per the payoff quote.
    *   **System Entry:** Enter the lienholder details (name, address, account number, amount) into the claims payment system.
    *   **Payment Method:** Payments are typically made via corporate check, electronic funds transfer (EFT), or wire transfer, based on lienholder preference and company policy.
3.  **Insured Remainder:** If the total loss settlement exceeds the lienholder payoff, issue a separate payment for the difference to the insured, less any applicable deductible. Ensure the deductible is applied to the gross settlement first.
4.  **Documentation:** Attach a copy of the finalized payoff statement and the settlement summary to the payment request.

#### 4.4.2. Scenario 2: Total Loss Settlement < Lienholder Payoff (Underwater Loan)

1.  **Notify Insured:** Immediately inform the insured that the total loss settlement is less than their outstanding loan balance.
2.  **Explain Shortfall:** Clearly explain that our company is only obligated to pay the ACV of the vehicle (less deductible) and that the insured is responsible for the remaining balance owed to the lienholder.
3.  **Payment Generation (Our Portion):** Issue payment directly to the lienholder for the *approved total loss settlement amount* (ACV less deductible, if applicable).
4.  **Confirm Insured's Plan:** Inquire with the insured how they intend to handle the remaining balance with the lienholder. Advise them to contact their lienholder to discuss options.
5.  **Documentation:** Document all communication regarding the shortfall with the insured in the claim file.

### 4.5. Title Procurement and Release

1.  **Lienholder Notification:** Send a formal letter or utilize the lienholder's designated process to request a physical release of lien or title transfer after the payoff check has been mailed or EFT confirmed. This should occur concurrently with payment.
2.  **Required Documents from Lienholder:** The lienholder is typically required to send either:
    *   A properly endorsed vehicle title, with the lien released.
    *   A Power of Attorney (POA) for title transfer, if the lienholder is processing the title through a third party.
    *   A Lien Release letter or similar document confirming satisfaction of the lien.
3.  **Salvage Buyer Coordination:** Coordinate with the salvage vendor to ensure they receive the title or documentation required to take possession of the salvaged vehicle.
4.  **Follow-up:** If the title or lien release is not received within 10 business days of payment, follow up with the lienholder. Document all follow-up attempts.
5.  **Title Defect/Delay:** If significant delays or issues arise with obtaining the title, escalate to a Total Loss Unit lead for assistance. This may involve contacting state DMV for guidance or sending demand letters to the lienholder.

### 4.6. Claim Finalization

1.  **Confirm Title Receipt:** Verify that the title or appropriate lien release documentation has been received and processed by either the salvage vendor or the internal title department.
2.  **Final Payment Audit:** Review all payments made on the claim (to lienholder, insured, salvage transport) to ensure accuracy.
3.  **Update Claim Status:** Mark the lienholder payoff and title release steps as complete in the claims system.
4.  **Close Claim:** Once all payments are disbursed, the title is secured, and all outstanding issues are resolved, the claim can be moved to closed status.

## 5. Requirements and Criteria

*   **Positive Lienholder Identification:** A valid lienholder name and account number must be identified prior to requesting a payoff.
*   **Written Payoff Quote:** A written payoff quote/statement from the lienholder is mandatory for all disbursements. Verbal quotes alone are not sufficient.
*   **Payment Accuracy:** All payments must match the approved payee and amount precisely.
*   **Timeliness:** Lienholder payoff requests and payments should be processed within 5 business days of ACV agreement and total loss declaration, to adhere to state regulations and avoid additional interest charges.
*   **Documentation:** All communications, payoff statements, payment confirmations, and title documents must be uploaded and accurately indexed in the claim file.

## 6. Exceptions

*   **Deceased Insured with Lien:** In cases of a deceased insured, follow standard procedures for deceased claimants, often requiring letters of testamentary or probate court orders before disbursing funds, in addition to lienholder procedures.
*   **Bankruptcy Filings:** If the insured has filed for bankruptcy, all payments (including to lienholders) may need to be held or routed through the bankruptcy court. Consult legal counsel immediately if a bankruptcy notice is received.
*   **Salvage Retained by Insured:** If the insured opts to retain salvage, the lienholder payoff procedure remains the same for our portion, but the insured is responsible for coordinating title release directly with the lienholder *after* receiving their net settlement (ACV - Deductible - Salvage Value).
*   **Foreign Lienholders:** Lienholders based outside of the primary operating country may require specialized payment methods (e.g., international wire transfers) and longer processing times.
