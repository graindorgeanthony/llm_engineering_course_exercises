# SOP: Home Property Claim Investigation

## 1. Overview
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the standardized process for conducting investigations of home and property insurance claims. The primary goal is to ensure thorough, consistent, and objective evidence collection to accurately assess claim validity, determine liability, and facilitate fair settlement decisions. This SOP covers initial claim review, site visit protocols, evidence documentation, and preliminary reporting.

## 2. Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide claims adjusters and investigation teams with a clear, step-by-step guide for investigating property damage claims. Adherence to this SOP minimizes variability in investigation quality, ensures compliance with regulatory requirements, and supports efficient resolution of claims.

## 3. Scope
This SOP applies to all direct property damage claims filed under homeowners, renters, and commercial property policies issued by [Your Company Name]. It covers claims involving physical damage to structures, contents, and related outbuildings due to covered perils such as fire, water, wind, vandalism, and theft.

### 3.1. Inclusions
*   Structural damage assessment
*   Personal property inventory and damage assessment
*   Cause and origin determination (initial assessment)
*   Policy coverage verification based on reported damage
*   Coordination with policyholders, contractors, and public officials

### 3.2. Exclusions
*   Catastrophic event (CAT) claim protocols (these are covered by *SOP-CAT-001*)
*   Liability-only claims without direct property damage
*   Subrogation actions (these are covered by *SOP-SUBRO-001*)
*   Claims requiring specialized forensic analysis (e.g., complex arson investigations, these are referred to *Forensic Investigations Unit*)

## 4. Definitions
*   **Adjuster:** The claims professional assigned to investigate and manage a claim.
*   **Claim File:** The complete record of all documents, communications, and evidence related to a specific claim.
*   **DRP:** Direct Repair Program – network of approved contractors.
*   **First Notice of Loss (FNOL):** The initial report of a claim by the policyholder or third party.
*   **Policyholder:** The individual or entity insured under the policy.
*   **Proof of Loss (POL):** A formal statement of the amount of monetary loss being claimed.
*   **Site Visit:** An in-person inspection of the damaged property by an Adjuster.

## 5. Initial Claim Review and Assignment
Upon receipt of a new property claim, the following steps must be completed within 24 business hours of FNOL.

### 5.1. Claim File Creation
1.  Verify policy existence and effective dates in **ClaimCenter System (CCS)**.
2.  Assign a unique claim number (e.g., HOP-2023-XXXXX).
3.  Log FNOL details, including date, time, reported peril, and policyholder contact information.

### 5.2. Policy and Coverage Verification
1.  Retrieve the full policy document (declarations page, endorsements, exclusions) from **Policy Admin System (PAS)**.
2.  Identify potential coverage issues based on reported peril and policy provisions.
    *   *Decision Logic:* If reported peril is explicitly excluded (e.g., flood without flood endorsement), flag for immediate review by a Senior Adjuster.
3.  Confirm deductible amount, coverage limits, and any specific endorsements (e.g., Service Line Coverage, Water Backup).

### 5.3. Adjuster Assignment
1.  Claims are assigned geographically and by complexity.
2.  Complex claims (e.g., reported fires, claims exceeding $50,000 estimated damage, claims with legal representation) must be assigned to Senior Adjusters.
3.  Initial contact with the policyholder to be made within 48 business hours of assignment.

## 6. Site Visit Protocols
A site visit is mandatory for all property claims exceeding an estimated damage threshold of $2,500 or when visual verification is critical for complex smaller claims.

### 6.1. Pre-Visit Preparation
1.  **Schedule Appointment:** Contact policyholder to schedule a mutually agreeable time. Confirm access arrangements.
2.  **Review Claim File:** Ensure all available information (FNOL, policy, photos, initial reports) is reviewed.
3.  **Gather Equipment:**
    *   PPE (hard hat, safety glasses, gloves, steel-toe boots)
    *   Measuring tape (25ft, 100ft)
    *   Digital camera/smartphone with timestamp and GPS capabilities
    *   Moisture meter
    *   Flashlight
    *   Claim forms (inspection checklist, personal property inventory)
    *   Business cards
    *   Drone (for roof/large structure damage, if certified)
4.  **Confirm Safety:** Assess any known hazards from FNOL (e.g., active structural collapse, gas leaks). If hazards exist, consult with supervisor and ensure proper safety protocols or specialized teams are engaged before visit.

### 6.2. On-Site Investigation Procedures

#### 6.2.1. Policyholder Interview (Upon Arrival)
1.  **Introduce Self:** Provide identification and explain the purpose of the visit.
2.  **Confirm Details:** Verify policyholder identity and claim details.
3.  **Obtain Narrative:** Ask the policyholder for a detailed account of the incident (how, when, where, what happened). Note inconsistencies or additional information not present in FNOL.
4.  **Inquire About Prior Damage/Repairs:** Ask about any pre-existing conditions or prior damage.
5.  **Explain Process:** Clearly outline the steps involved in the inspection, evidence collection, and subsequent claim processing.
6.  **Obtain Authorization:** Secure written consent for privacy disclosure and photo/video recording if required by local regulations or company policy.

#### 6.2.2. Property Inspection
1.  **Exterior Inspection:**
    *   Photograph entire exterior of the property from multiple angles.
    *   Inspect roof, siding, windows, doors, gutters, and foundation for damage.
    *   Document surrounding property, including trees, fences, and adjacent structures.
    *   Measure and sketch property dimensions if necessary for large or complex losses.
    *   *Requirement:* At least four exterior photos (front, rear, both sides).
2.  **Interior Inspection:**
    *   Systematically inspect each affected room, documenting all damage.
    *   Use a moisture meter in water damage claims to identify affected areas and moisture levels.
    *   Photograph damaged contents in situ before any removal.
    *   *Requirement:* Every damaged area/item must be photographed from at least two different angles.
3.  **Cause and Origin:**
    *   Identify potential cause and origin of damage. Look for evidence supporting or refuting the reported peril (e.g., burn patterns for fire, water lines for flood, impact points for wind).
    *   Do not speculate on cause and origin if evidence is inconclusive; note observations and recommend expert review if needed.
4.  **Scope of Damage:**
    *   Document the full extent of damage, distinguishing between pre-existing, related, and unrelated damage.
    *   Take detailed measurements of damaged areas (e.g., linear feet of damaged drywall, square footage of damaged flooring).
5.  **Hazard Identification:**
    *   Note any immediate safety hazards (e.g., exposed wiring, asbestos, structural instability).
    *   Advise policyholder on necessary temporary repairs for safety and mitigation of further damage.

### 6.3. Evidence Collection
1.  **Photographs/Videos:**
    *   Date and timestamp all digital media.
    *   Capture broad overview shots and detailed close-ups of damage.

    *   *Evidence:* Receipts or photos of damaged items.
5.  **Third-Party Information:**
    *   Collect contact information for any witnesses, emergency services (fire department, police), or contractors present.
    *   Obtain copies of fire/police reports if generated.

## 7. Post-Site Visit Documentation
Within 24 business hours of completing the site visit, the Adjuster must upload all collected evidence into the CCS.

### 7.1. Claim Narrative Update
1.  Provide a detailed chronological report of the investigation, including:
    *   Date and time of site visit.
    *   Attendees (policyholder, Adjuster, others).
    *   Observations of the property and damage.
    *   Summary of policyholder interview.
    *   Preliminary assessment of cause and origin.
    *   Initial estimation of damage scope.
    *   Any safety concerns or temporary repairs recommended.

### 7.2. Photo/Video Log
1.  Upload all photos and videos, ensuring they are correctly tagged and categorized within the claim file.

### 7.3. Damage Estimate (Preliminary)
1.  Prepare a preliminary estimate of repair costs using Xactimate or similar approved software.
2.  Flag claims exceeding the Adjuster's settlement authority for Supervisor review.

## 8. Reporting and Next Steps
### 8.1. Initial Claim Decision Criteria
*   **Covered Loss:** If damage is clearly caused by a covered peril, the claim proceeds to estimate finalization and settlement.
*   **Non-Covered Loss:** If damage is clearly caused by an excluded peril, prepare a denial letter with clear policy references. This requires Supervisor approval.
*   **Questionable Loss:** If coverage is ambiguous, cause and origin are unclear, or fraud indicators are present, refer the claim to the *Claim Referrals and Special Investigations Unit (SIU)*.

### 8.2. Communication with Policyholder
1.  Provide policyholder with a status update within five business days of the site visit.
2.  Inform them of next steps (e.g., DRP contractor assignment, request for more documentation, coverage decision).

### 8.3. Contractor Coordination
1.  For covered losses, recommend DRP contractors or advise policyholder on obtaining multiple contractor bids, as per policy terms.
2.  Ensure contractors understand the approved scope of work.

## 9. Exceptions
*   **Catastrophic Events:** During declared CAT events, specific rapid response protocols will supersede some detailed documentation requirements outlined here (refer to *SOP-CAT-001*).
*   **Virtual Adjusting:** For minor claims (< $2,500 estimated damage, specific perils like minor pipe burst), virtual inspections via video conference may be approved by a Supervisor, reducing the need for an in-person site visit. Requires documented approval.
*   **Appraisal Clause Invocation:** If either party invokes the appraisal process as per the policy, specific appraisal procedures will apply.

## 10. Evidence/Documentation Requirements
All claims must contain the following in the digital claim file:
*   FNOL Report
*   Policy Declarations Page and relevant endorsements
*   Adjuster's Site Visit Report / Narrative
*   Timestamped and geotagged photographs/videos of damage and property
*   Diagrams/Sketches (if applicable)
*   Personal Property Inventory (if applicable)
*   Communication log with policyholder
*   Preliminary Damage Estimate
*   Any relevant third-party reports (e.g., Fire Department, Police)
