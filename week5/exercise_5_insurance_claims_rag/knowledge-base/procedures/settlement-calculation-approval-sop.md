# SOP: Settlement Calculation and Approval

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the standardized process for calculating claim settlements and obtaining the necessary financial and operational approvals within [Organization Name]. The purpose of this document is to ensure fairness, accuracy, compliance with policy terms, and adherence to regulatory requirements and internal financial controls. This SOP aims to streamline the settlement process, minimize errors, and improve decision-making efficiency for claims agents.

## 2. Scope

This SOP applies to all claim types processed by the Claims Department that result in a financial settlement to a policyholder or third party. This includes, but is not limited to, property claims, casualty claims, and liability claims exceeding a de minimis threshold of $500.

**Exclusions:**
*   Initial claim intake and preliminary eligibility assessment (covered under "Claims Intake SOP").
*   Fraud investigation procedures (covered under "Fraud Detection and Investigation SOP").
*   Denial of claims where no settlement is offered.
*   Claims with a settlement value equal to or less than $500 (these require supervisor approval only, without a detailed calculation worksheet).

## 3. Definitions

*   **Claim Adjuster (CA):** The assigned individual responsible for investigating, evaluating, and negotiating the claim.
*   **Settlement Calculation Worksheet (SCW):** A standardized document used to detail the itemized calculation of the proposed settlement amount, including all relevant factors.
*   **Delegated Authority Limit (DAL):** The maximum financial amount a specific role or individual is authorized to approve for a settlement without requiring escalation.
*   **Claims Review Committee (CRC):** A standing committee responsible for reviewing and approving high-value or complex settlements exceeding senior management DALs.
*   **Proof of Loss (POL):** A formal statement made by the policyholder to the insurer regarding the estimated loss amount.

## 4. Main Content: Settlement Calculation Procedure

### 4.1. Gathering Required Inputs

Before initiating settlement calculation, the CA must ensure all necessary documentation and information are available:
1.  **Claim File Completion:** Confirm all investigative reports, expert assessments (e.g., forensics, appraisals), witness statements, and policy documents are filed and complete.
2.  **Policy Review:** Verify policy coverage, limits, deductibles, endorsements, and any applicable exclusions or limitations.
3.  **Damage Assessment:** Obtain final repair estimates, medical bills, property valuations, or other documented evidence of loss.
4.  **Proof of Loss (POL):** Ensure a completed and signed POL is received from the claimant, if required by policy or claim type.
5.  **Legal/Regulatory Review:** For complex liability claims, consult with legal counsel to assess potential litigation exposure and determine appropriate reserves.

### 4.2. Initiating Settlement Calculation

1.  **Open New SCW:** Access and populate the latest version of the "Settlement Calculation Worksheet" (Form CS-003a) within the Claims Management System (CMS).
2.  **Itemize Damages:** Systematically list all accepted and quantifiable damages or losses based on evidence gathered.
    *   For property: List repair costs, replacement costs, depreciation, loss of use, deductible.
    *   For medical: List allowed medical expenses, future medical projections, lost wages.
    *   For liability: List assessed damages, legal costs, pain and suffering (if applicable and quantifiable).
3.  **Apply Policy Terms:**
    *   Deduct applicable deductibles or co-payments.
    *   Apply depreciation according to policy terms and asset age/condition.
    *   Ensure total settlement does not exceed policy limits for each coverage type.
    *   Account for any sub-limits, aggregate limits, or special endorsements.
4.  **Calculate Net Settlement:** Sum all allowable damages, subtract deductibles and depreciation, and apply any other offsets or additions specified by policy or law. The final figure is the proposed gross settlement amount.

### 4.3. Documenting the Settlement Justification

1.  **Narrative Summary:** In the SCW, add a detailed narrative section explaining the rationale for the settlement amount. This should refer to specific policy clauses, investigative findings, and evidence.
2.  **Supporting Documents:** Attach all relevant supporting documents (estimates, invoices, medical records, expert reports) to the SCW within the CMS. Ensure each attachment is accurately linked to the corresponding line item in the calculation.

## 5. Requirements and Approval Criteria

All settlements require approval based on the following Delegated Authority Limits (DALs) and criteria:

### 5.1. Delegated Authority Limits (DALs)

| Role/Position                | Approval Limit (CAD) | Required Approvals              |
| :--------------------------- | :------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| Claims Adjuster (CA)         | Up to $10,000        | CA submits, Supervisor reviews  |
| Claims Supervisor            | Up to $50,000        | CA, Supervisor                  |
| Claims Manager               | Up to $250,000       | CA, Supervisor, Claims Manager  |
| Director of Claims           | Up to $1,000,000     | CA, Sup, Mgr, Director          |
| VP, Claims Operations        | Up to $5,000,000     | CA, Sup, Mgr, Dir, VP           |
| Claims Review Committee (CRC) | Over $5,000,000      | CA, Sup, Mgr, Dir, VP, CRC      |

### 5.2. General Approval Criteria

*   **Accuracy:** All calculations must be free of mathematical errors.
*   **Justification:** Every component of the settlement must be justifiable by evidence in the claim file and consistent with policy terms.
*   **Compliance:** Settlement must comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, industry standards, and internal policies.
*   **Documentation:** All required supporting documents must be attached and referenced.
*   **Reasonableness:** The proposed settlement amount must be reasonable given the nature and extent of the loss.
*   **Negotiation Notes:** For negotiated settlements, detailed negotiation logs must be included in the claim file, documenting offers, counter-offers, and rationale for final agreement.

## 6. Procedures: Settlement Approval Workflow

### 6.1. Submission for Approval

1.  **CA Submission:** Once the SCW is complete and fully justified, the CA digitally submits the SCW and associated claim file for approval through the Claims Management System (CMS).
2.  **System Routing:** The CMS automatically routes the claim to the appropriate approver(s) based on the calculated settlement amount and the DAL matrix.

### 6.2. Review and Decision

1.  **Approver Review:** Each approver (Supervisor, Manager, Director, VP) reviews the entire SCW, supporting documentation, and the CA's narrative summary.
    *   Approvers verify accuracy, completeness, compliance, and reasonableness.
    *   They may request additional information or clarification from the CA.
2.  **Approval/Rejection:**
    *   **Approve:** If satisfied, the approver digitally signs off in the CMS, and the claim proceeds to the next level of approval if required, or finalization if within their DAL.
    *   **Reject/Return for Revision:** If deficiencies are found, the approver returns the SCW to the CA with clear, documented reasons for rejection and required actions. The CA must address these issues and resubmit.

### 6.3. Claims Review Committee (CRC) Process (for settlements > $5,000,000)

1.  **CRC Submission:** For claims exceeding the VP's DAL, the VP, Claims Operations, prepares a comprehensive CRC submission package, including:
    *   Executive Summary of the claim and proposed settlement.
    *   Full SCW and key supporting documents.
    *   Risk assessment, including potential legal ramifications.
    *   Justification for the high-value settlement.
2.  **CRC Meeting:** The CRC convenes to review the submission. The CA, along with the Director and VP, may be required to present the case and answer questions.
3.  **CRC Decision:** The CRC votes on the proposed settlement. A majority vote is required for approval. The CRC's decision is final.

## 7. Exceptions

*   **Emergency Settlements:** In cases of extreme urgency (e.g., natural disaster necessitating immediate relief), a verbal approval may be granted by the highest available authority, followed by immediate documentation and formal approval within 24 hours. The verbal approval must be documented in the claim file with date, time, approver name, and reason for urgency.
*   **Court-Ordered Settlements:** Settlements mandated by a court order or binding arbitration do not require internal DAL hierarchy approval beyond legal department review, but must still be formally documented in an SCW and approved by a Claims Manager to ensure record-keeping.

## 8. Examples
