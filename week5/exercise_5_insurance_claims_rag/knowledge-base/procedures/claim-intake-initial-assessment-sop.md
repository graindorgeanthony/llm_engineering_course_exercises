# SOP: Claim Intake and Initial Assessment

## 1. Overview/Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the standardized process for the initial intake and preliminary assessment of all new claims submitted to [Insurance Company Name]. The purpose of this SOP is to ensure efficient and accurate data collection, proper claim routing, and consistent initial evaluation to facilitate timely claims processing and improve decision-making. Adherence to this procedure minimizes errors, reduces processing delays, and enhances overall customer experience.

## 2. Scope

This SOP applies to all Claims Department personnel responsible for receiving new claim notifications, inputting claim data, and conducting the initial assessment. This includes Claims Intake Specialists, Junior Adjusters, and designated administrative staff.

**Included:**
*   Receipt of claims via all channels (online portal, email, phone, mail, fax).
*   Verification of policyholder and policy details.
*   Initial incident data recording.
*   Preliminary eligibility check.
*   Assignment of claim number and initial status.
*   Basic risk assessment and fraud indicator identification.

**Excluded:**
*   Detailed claim investigation (post-initial assessment).
*   Complex loss adjusting or settlement negotiations.
*   Specific claims for specialized lines of business (e.g., Catastrophe claims, large commercial losses) that have dedicated SOPs for initial handling, beyond the general intake.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Claim Notification:** The initial communication from a policyholder or third party reporting an incident that may result in a claim.
*   **Claim Intake Specialist (CIS):** Personnel responsible for receiving and processing new claim notifications.
*   **Policyholder:** The individual or entity insured under the policy.
*   **Insured Event:** The incident or occurrence that gives rise to the claim (e.g., accident, damage, loss).
*   **Claim Number:** A unique identifier assigned to each new claim for tracking purposes.
*   **Preliminary Assessment:** A high-level review of the claim notification to determine basic eligibility and severity before full investigation.
*   **First Notice of Loss (FNOL):** The initial reporting of a claim event to the insurer.

## 4. Procedures/Steps

### 4.1. Claim Notification Receipt and Logging

1.  **Receive Claim Notification:**
    *   **Online Portal:** System automatically creates a draft claim record. CIS to review and validate.
    *   **Email/Mail/Fax:** CIS to manually create a new claim record in the Claims Management System (CMS). Attach all received documentation.
    *   **Phone Call:** CIS to conduct an interview with the caller, accurately transcribing information directly into the CMS.
2.  **Acknowledge Receipt:**
    *   For online/email submissions, an automated confirmation email will be sent within 1 hour.
    *   For phone/mail/fax, CIS to send a manual acknowledgment email/letter within 24 business hours as per standard templates (Template ID: ACK-TPL-001).
3.  **Log Basic Information:**
    *   Date and time of notification.
    *   Method of notification (e.g., "Portal", "Phone Call", "Email").
    *   Name and contact details of the notifier (if different from policyholder).

### 4.2. Policyholder and Policy Verification

1.  **Retrieve Policy Details:**
    *   Using the policy number (if provided) or policyholder’s name/address, search and retrieve the active policy record from the Policy Administration System (PAS).
    *   If no policy number is provided, search by policyholder name, address, or other identifiers.
2.  **Verify Policy Status:**
    *   Confirm the policy was active at the time of the alleged incident (Date of Loss).
    *   Verify the policy type and coverage limits relevant to the incident.
    *   Check for any endorsements, exclusions, or special conditions applicable to the policy.
3.  **Confirm Policyholder Identity:**
    *   Cross-reference caller/notifier details with policyholder information in PAS.
    *   If the notifier is not the policyholder, document their relationship and authority (e.g., "spouse," "legal representative," "authorized agent").

### 4.3. Incident Data Collection

1.  **Record Date and Time of Loss (DOL/TOL):**
    *   Obtain the exact or estimated date and time the incident occurred.
    *   If estimated, note "approximate" and record why (e.g., "found damage later").
2.  **Document Incident Description:**
    *   Obtain a narrative of what happened, where it happened, who was involved, and what was damaged/lost.
    *   Use open-ended questions to gather detailed information (e.g., "Can you describe exactly what occurred?", "Where were you when this happened?").
    *   Record any witnesses or third parties involved.
3.  **Identify Loss Type:**
    *   Categorize the loss (e.g., "Vehicle Collision," "Property Theft," "Personal Injury," "Property Damage - Fire," "Water Damage"). Select from predefined categories in CMS.
4.  **Estimate Initial Reserve/Severity:**
    *   Based solely on the initial description, provide a preliminary estimate of the potential financial impact (e.g., "Low: < $5,000," "Medium: $5,000 - $25,000," "High: > $25,000"). This is a placeholder for initial routing, not a final reserve.

### 4.4. Preliminary Eligibility Check

1.  **Policy In-Force:** Was the policy active on the Date of Loss?
    *   **YES:** Proceed to Coverage Review.
    *   **NO:** Decline initial claim (Reason Code: POL-EXP). Inform notifier and document.
2.  **Loss Type Covered:** Does the reported loss type generally fall under the policy coverage?
    *   **YES:** Proceed to Exclusions Check.
    *   **NO (Obvious Exclusion):** Decline initial claim (Reason Code: LTYPE-EXC). Inform notifier and document.
3.  **Exclusions Review:** Are there any immediate and obvious exclusions that apply based on the initial description?
    *   Example: Policy excludes water damage from flood, and incident is clearly reported as flood.
    *   **NO Obvious Exclusions:** Proceed to Policy Limits Check.
    *   **YES Obvious Exclusion:** Route for immediate adjuster review for denial consideration (Claim Status: REVIEW-DENIAL).
4.  **Policy Limits and Deductibles:**
    *   Note applicable deductibles and policy limits based on coverage. Inform policyholder verbally if on call, or ensure acknowledgment in initial communication.
    *   No immediate decision, but awareness for subsequent steps.

### 4.5. Claim Number Assignment and Initial Status

1.  **Assign Claim Number:**
    *   Upon successful initial data entry and preliminary eligibility check, the CMS will automatically generate a unique claim number (Format: YYYYMMDD-#####-LOC).
2.  **Set Initial Claim Status:**
    *   **Open - Initial Assessment Complete:** For claims proceeding to investigation.
    *   **Pending - Clarification Required:** If critical information is missing from the policyholder.
    *   **Closed - Not Covered (Initial Review):** For claims clearly outside policy terms.
3.  **Route Claim:**
    *   **Low Severity/Standard Claims:** Route to Standard Claims Team.
    *   **Medium/High Severity/Complex:** Route to Senior Adjuster Team based on estimated loss and type.
    *   **Potential Fraud Indicators Identified:** Route to SIU (Special Investigative Unit) Referral Queue. (See Section 4.6).
    *   **Clarification Required:** Route back to CIS for follow-up with policyholder.

### 4.6. Fraud Indicator Identification

During intake, CIS must be vigilant for common fraud red flags. If any are observed, document them in the "Fraud Indicators" section of the claim record and route to the SIU.

**Fraud Indicators (Non-Exhaustive List):**
*   Inconsistent statements from policyholder/notifier.
*   Reporting incident just after policy inception or significant policy change.
*   Unusual or elaborate descriptions of loss.
*   Reluctance to provide details or answer questions.
*   Claiming excessive or unusual items lost/damaged without supporting evidence.
*   History of previous claims, especially those with suspicious circumstances.
*   Damages disproportionate to the alleged incident.
*   Reluctance to allow inspection of damaged property.
*   Reporting a loss that seems physically impossible given the circumstances.
*   Claiming items that are known to be difficult to value or trace (e.g., cash, unique collectibles).

## 5. Requirements/Criteria

*   All data fields marked as "mandatory" in the CMS must be completed.
*   Policy verification via PAS is required for every claim.
*   Fraud indicators must be documented accurately and promptly.
*   Claims must be routed to the appropriate department within 2 business hours of completion of initial assessment (Step 4.5).
*   Acknowledgment to policyholder within 24 business hours.

## 6. Exceptions

*   **Catastrophe Events (CAT Claims):** During declared CAT events, initial intake procedures may be streamlined or handled by a dedicated CAT team with a separate, abbreviated SOP. CIS alerted via company-wide notification.
*   **Third-Party Notifications:** If a claim is reported by a third party (e.g., another insurer, police), obtain best available information and attempt to contact policyholder within 48 hours for verification.
*   **Missing Policy Information:** If policy cannot be located despite thorough search (Step 4.2), elevate to Claims Team Lead for manual review and guidance within 1 hour. Do not assign a claim number until a valid policy is identified or a decision is made to deny on grounds of no coverage.

## 7. Examples

**Example 1: Standard Auto Collision**
*   **Receipt:** Policyholder calls to report a rear-end collision.
*   **Verification:** CIS confirms active auto policy for policyholder John Doe, effective 2022-01-01 to 2024-01-01. Deductible: $500.
*   **Incident Data:** DOL: 2023-10-25 10:30 AM, Intersection of Main St & Elm Ave. John's vehicle hit from behind. Minor damage to rear bumper. Other driver exchanged info.
*   **Eligibility:** Policy active, collision covered. No obvious exclusions.
*   **Routing:** Claim # 20231026-00123-AUTO assigned. Status: Open - Initial Assessment Complete. Routed to Standard Auto Claims Team.

**Example 2: Suspicious Property Theft**
*   **Receipt:** Policyholder emails claiming theft of jewelry and electronics from an unlocked apartment window.
*   **Verification:** Homeowners policy active since 2023-09-01. Coverage for theft.
*   **Incident Data:** DOL: 2023-10-20 (reported 5 days later). Policyholder states items worth ~$50,000 were stolen. Apartment was unlocked. No police report filed yet.
*   **Eligibility:** Policy active, theft covered. High value, late reporting, and unlocked dwelling are potential red flags.
*   **Fraud Indicator:** Late reporting, no police report, high value items, unlocked access.
*   **Routing:** Claim # 20231026-00124-HOME assigned. Status: Open - Initial Assessment Complete. Routed to SIU Referral Queue for review by Special Investigator.
