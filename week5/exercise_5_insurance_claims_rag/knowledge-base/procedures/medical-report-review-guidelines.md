# Guidelines: Medical Report Review for Claims

## 1. Overview

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the guidelines for claims adjusters when reviewing and interpreting medical reports submitted in support of injury-related insurance claims. The purpose is to ensure consistent, accurate, and efficient evaluation of medical documentation to determine claim validity, assess injury severity, establish causation, and estimate appropriate reserves and settlements. Adherence to these guidelines supports fair claim adjudication and optimal resource allocation.

## 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all claims adjusters responsible for handling personal injury, disability, and worker's compensation claims where medical reports, physician statements, diagnostic imaging results, and treatment records are submitted as evidence. It covers the initial review, ongoing assessment, and interpretation of medical documentation throughout the life cycle of a claim. This SOP does not cover the legal aspects of medical malpractice or litigation; however, it informs decisions that may lead to legal review.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Medical Report:** A document prepared by a healthcare professional detailing patient's medical history, examination findings, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment plan. Examples include physician's notes, specialist consultations, hospital records, and diagnostic reports.
*   **Causation:** The link between the covered incident (e.g., accident, injury event) and the reported medical condition or disability.
*   **Pre-existing Condition:** A health condition that existed prior to the alleged injury or onset of symptoms related to the current claim.
*   **Maximum Medical Improvement (MMI):** The point at which a patient's medical condition has stabilized and further significant improvement is not expected with continued medical treatment.
*   **Prognosis:** The likely course of a medical condition; the forecast of the outcome of a disease or injury.
*   **Activities of Daily Living (ADLs):** Basic self-care tasks such as eating, bathing, dressing, toileting, ambulating, and transferring.
*   **Independent Medical Examination (IME):** An examination conducted by an independent physician, chosen by the insurer, to provide an objective assessment of the claimant's medical condition, causation, and treatment needs.

## 4. Initial Medical Report Review Procedure

Upon receipt of a new medical report or related documentation, adjusters must follow these steps:

### 4.1. Document Verification

1.  **Confirm Authenticity:** Verify the report originates from a licensed healthcare provider. Check for physician's signature, practice letterhead, and date.
2.  **Match Claimant Information:** Ensure the report pertains to the correct claimant (name, date of birth, policy number if applicable).
3.  **Completeness Check:** Ascertain if all requested pages/sections of the report are present. Flag any missing information immediately for follow-up.

### 4.2. Key Information Extraction

1.  **Date of Injury/Onset:** Identify the reported date of injury or symptom onset and compare it to the reported incident date.
2.  **Diagnoses (ICD-10 Codes):** Note all official diagnoses presented. Assess if they are consistent with the reported incident.
3.  **Mechanism of Injury:** Understand how the injury reportedly occurred and if it aligns with the claimed incident circumstances.
4.  **Symptoms & Physical Findings:** Document presenting symptoms, subjective complaints, and objective findings from physical examinations.
5.  **History of Present Illness (HPI):** Review the narrative description of the claimant's current medical issues.
6.  **Past Medical History (PMH):** Identify any relevant pre-existing conditions that could impact causation or recovery. Pay close attention to conditions affecting the same body parts or systems.
7.  **Diagnostic Test Results:** Summarize findings from X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, nerve conduction studies (NCS), etc. Note any objective abnormalities.
8.  **Treatment Plan:** Detail recommended treatments, medications, therapies (e.g., physical therapy, chiropractic, occupational therapy), specialist referrals, and surgical recommendations.
9.  **Work Status/Disability:** Note any stated work restrictions, limitations, or declarations of disability. Identify start and end dates if provided.
10. **Prognosis & MMI:** Assess the physician's outlook on recovery, estimated duration of disability, and anticipated MMI date.

## 5. Medical Causation and Exacerbation Assessment

### 5.1. Establishing Causation

*   **Direct Causation:** The medical condition is a direct and immediate result of the covered incident (e.g., fractured arm from a fall). Look for explicit statements from the treating physician.
*   **Aggravation/Exacerbation:** A pre-existing condition is made worse by the covered incident. The report must clearly distinguish between the pre-existing condition and the newly aggravated symptoms or injury.
*   **Temporal Relationship:** Is there a clear timeline linking the incident to the onset of symptoms and treatment? Significant gaps (e.g., months without symptoms post-incident before treatment sought) may raise questions.

### 5.2. Red Flags for Causation Issues

*   **Lack of Objective Findings:** Symptoms are purely subjective with no corresponding objective findings on examination or diagnostic tests.
*   **Pre-existing Conditions:** Medical records indicate significant prior issues with the same body part/system that are not clearly distinguished from post-incident issues.
*   **Delayed Reporting:** Symptoms or treatment commence significantly after the alleged incident without reasonable explanation.
*   **Inconsistent Mechanism of Injury:** The reported injury mechanism does not credibly explain the diagnosed condition (e.g., minor impact leading to severe, non-contact injury).
*   **Non-Attributable Diagnoses:** Diagnoses (e.g., degenerative disc disease, fibromyalgia) that are often chronic or developmental and not typically caused by a single acute incident.

## 6. Treatment Plan Evaluation

### 6.1. Appropriateness of Treatment

Adjusters must evaluate if the proposed treatment plan is:
*   **Medically Necessary:** Does the treatment address the diagnosed condition and aim to improve the claimant's functional status?
*   **Reasonable:** Is the frequency, duration, and type of treatment consistent with generally accepted medical guidelines for the specific injury/condition?
*   **Goal-Oriented:** Does the treatment plan have clear, measurable goals for recovery or symptom management?

### 6.2. Common Treatment Considerations

*   **Conservative Care First:** Most injuries initially require conservative management (e.g., physical therapy, medication, rest). Surgical recommendations without prior conservative attempts require closer scrutiny.
*   **Duration of Therapy:** Prolonged therapy without demonstrated functional improvement should prompt inquiry or a request for a progress report. Typical physical therapy courses are 6-12 weeks.
*   **Medication Review:** Assess the necessity and duration of prescribed medications, particularly opioids.
*   **Specialist Referrals:** Evaluate if the referral is justified based on the nature of the injury and the primary treating physician's scope.

## 7. Disability Assessment and Return to Work

### 7.1. Evaluating Work Restrictions and Limitations

*   **Specificity:** Assess if restrictions are specific (e.g., "lift no more than 10 lbs," "no prolonged standing") rather than general ("disabled").
*   **Consistency:** Are restrictions consistent with the diagnosed injury and objective findings?
*   **Functional Limitations:** Identify how physical limitations impact the claimant's ability to perform their occupation or ADLs.

### 7.2. Return to Work Planning

*   **Temporary vs. Permanent:** Distinguish between temporary disability and potential permanent impairment.
*   **Gradual Return:** Physicians often recommend a gradual return to work, including light duty or reduced hours. Facilitate communication with the employer where possible.
*   **Maximum Medical Improvement (MMI):** Once MMI is reached, the focus shifts to vocational rehabilitation or assessment of permanent impairment, if applicable.

## 8. Requirements for Further Action/Referral

### 8.1. Referral for Independent Medical Examination (IME)

Consider an IME when:
*   There is a significant dispute regarding causation, extent of injury, or appropriate treatment plan.
*   Treatment is prolonged without significant improvement.
*   The claimant has reached MMI, and a permanent impairment rating is needed.
*   The medical report lacks clarity or consistency.
*   Proposed treatment is high-cost (e.g., surgery) or experimental.
*   There are inconsistencies between reported symptoms and objective findings.

### 8.2. Request for Additional Information

Contact the treating physician or review facility when:
*   Key information is missing from the report (e.g., past medical history, diagnostic results).
*   The report is illegible or unclear.
*   Clarification is needed regarding work restrictions, prognosis, or specific treatment recommendations.
*   To obtain further medical records (past records, prior diagnostic tests).

### 8.3. Peer Review/Medical Advisor Consultation

Engage internal medical advisors or external peer reviewers for complex cases, significant medical conditions, or when there's a need for expert medical opinion beyond the adjuster's scope.

## 9. Documentation and Communication

### 9.1. Claim File Documentation

All medical reports, adjuster's review notes, questions, and decisions must be logged thoroughly in the claim file management system. Include:
*   Date report received and reviewed.
*   Key findings summarized.
*   Causation analysis.
*   Treatment plan assessment.
*   Recommended next steps (e.g., IME, request for records).
*   Rationale for decisions made.

### 9.2. Communication with Claimant and Providers

*   Maintain professional communication with claimants regarding their medical status and how it relates to their claim.
*   Clearly articulate any information requests or reasons for referral to an IME.
*   Ensure all necessary authorization forms (e.g., HIPAA waivers) are obtained from the claimant for medical record sharing.

## 10. Exceptions

*   **Minor Cuts/Bruises:** For very minor injuries, a brief physician's note confirming diagnosis and fitness for work may suffice without extensive review as per these guidelines.
*   **Emergency Situations:** In immediate emergency situations requiring urgent authorization, initial approval can be granted based on reasonable medical judgment, with detailed review following once documentation is available.
*   **Jurisdictional Variations:** Specific state or national regulations regarding medical report handling (e.g., worker's compensation panels, review timelines) supersede these general guidelines where applicable. Adjusters must be aware of and comply with all specific legal requirements in their jurisdiction.
