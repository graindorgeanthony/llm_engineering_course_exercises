# SOP: Vendor Management for Repairs

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the guidelines and processes for selecting, engaging, managing, and evaluating third-party repair vendors utilized for claims processing. The purpose is to ensure efficient, cost-effective, and high-quality repair services, maintain compliance with contractual agreements, and uphold claimant satisfaction. This SOP applies to all repair claims requiring external vendor involvement.

## 2. Scope

This SOP covers the entire lifecycle of vendor management for repair services, from initial qualification and onboarding through ongoing performance monitoring and offboarding. It applies to all claims personnel, claims adjusters, and vendor management teams involved in authorizing or coordinating repair activities for insured losses.

**Inclusions:**
*   Vendor qualification and onboarding
*   Repair assignment and authorization
*   Performance monitoring and quality assurance
*   Invoice processing and payment
*   Dispute resolution
*   Vendor offboarding

**Exclusions:**
*   Negotiation of master service agreements (MSAs) (handled by Procurement)
*   Large-scale infrastructure or catastrophic event (CAT) response vendor networks (separate protocols apply)
*   Internal repair services or in-house repair technicians

## 3. Definitions

*   **Approved Vendor List (AVL):** A pre-qualified list of repair vendors authorized to perform services for our claimants.
*   **Service Level Agreement (SLA):** A contractual agreement defining specific service standards and performance metrics expected from a vendor.
*   **Repair Estimate:** A detailed breakdown of anticipated costs and labor for a repair job.
*   **Claim Adjuster:** The company representative responsible for evaluating claims and authorizing repairs.
*   **Vendor Management System (VMS):** The internal software platform used to manage vendor information, assignments, and performance.
*   **Quality Audit:** A systematic review of a vendor's repair work to ensure compliance with quality standards and estimates.

## 4. Vendor Qualification and Onboarding

### 4.1. Vendor Application and Initial Screening

1.  **Application:** Potential repair vendors submit an application via the Vendor Management Portal, including business licenses, certifications, insurance details, and references.
2.  **Initial Review:** Vendor Management Team (VMT) reviews applications for completeness and basic compliance.
3.  **Mandatory Requirements:**
    *   Valid business license in operating jurisdictions.
    *   Minimum $1,000,000 General Liability insurance.
    *   Workers' Compensation insurance (where required by law).
    *   Appropriate industry-specific certifications (e.g., I-CAR for auto body, IICRC for water restoration).
    *   Minimum 3 years in business with demonstrable experience in relevant repair areas.
    *   Positive reviews from at least 3 verifiable references.

### 4.2. Due Diligence and Background Checks

1.  **Financial Stability:** Credit check and review of financial statements for vendors proposing high-value or long-term contracts.
2.  **Reputation Check:** Online reputation search, Better Business Bureau (BBB) checks, and review of public records for any significant legal or regulatory issues.
3.  **Site Visit/Interview:** For critical repair categories (e.g., structural, hazmat), a VMT representative may conduct an on-site visit to assess facilities, equipment, and safety protocols.

### 4.3. Contractual Agreement and Onboarding

1.  **MSA Execution:** Qualified vendors execute a Master Service Agreement (MSA) and Service Level Agreement (SLA) outlining terms, pricing, quality standards, and reporting requirements.
2.  **System Integration:** Vendors are provisioned access to the VMS for receiving assignments, submitting estimates, and invoicing.
3.  **Training:** Vendors receive training on company-specific processes, VMS usage, and communication protocols.
4.  **Addition to AVL:** Upon successful completion of all steps, the vendor is added to the Approved Vendor List (AVL).

## 5. Repair Assignment and Authorization

### 5.1. Assignment Logic

1.  **Geographic Proximity:** VMS automatically prioritizes vendors based on proximity to the claim site.
2.  **Specialty Match:** VMS identifies vendors with specific certifications or expertise required for the repair (e.g., roof repair, electronics, water damage restoration).
3.  **Performance Metrics:** Priority is given to vendors with higher performance scores (e.g., lower cycle times, higher quality scores, fewer disputes).
4.  **Load Balancing:** System distributes new assignments among available and qualified vendors to ensure equitable workload and prevent over-reliance on a single vendor.

### 5.2. Estimate Submission and Review

1.  **Vendor Submits Estimate:** Assigned vendor conducts an inspection and submits a detailed repair estimate via the VMS within 3 business days of receiving the assignment.
2.  **Claim Adjuster Review:** The Claim Adjuster reviews the estimate against company guidelines, reasonable pricing benchmarks, and the scope of damage.
3.  **Approval or Negotiation:**
    *   **Approval:** If the estimate is within acceptable parameters (e.g., +/- 15% of internal benchmark or under $5,000 for standard repairs), the Claim Adjuster approves it in the VMS.
    *   **Negotiation:** If the estimate exceeds thresholds or contains discrepancies, the Claim Adjuster negotiates with the vendor for adjustments. All negotiations must be documented in the VMS.
    *   **Escalation:** If negotiations fail, the Claim Adjuster escalates to the Claims Manager, who may reassign the repair to another AVL vendor.

### 5.3. Repair Authorization

1.  Upon approval of the estimate, the Claim Adjuster issues a formal Work Authorization through the VMS to the vendor.
2.  The Work Authorization specifies the approved scope, cost, and expected completion date.
3.  No work should commence without a formal Work Authorization.

## 6. Performance Monitoring and Quality Assurance

### 6.1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Vendors are continuously monitored against the following KPIs, tracked within the VMS:

*   **Response Time:** Time from assignment to initial contact with claimant/inspection. Target: < 24 hours.
*   **Estimate Submission Time:** Time from inspection to estimate submission. Target: < 3 business days.
*   **Cycle Time:** Time from work authorization to repair completion. Varies by repair type (e.g., 7 days for minor auto body, 30 days for major home damage).
*   **Claimant Satisfaction Score:** Based on post-repair surveys. Target: > 4.0 out of 5.0.
*   **Quality Audit Score:** Based on internal quality checks. Target: > 90%.
*   **Estimate Accuracy:** Variance between initial estimate and final invoice. Target: < 10% deviation.
*   **Dispute Rate:** Number of escalated issues or complaints. Target: < 2% of assignments.

### 6.2. Quality Audits

1.  **Random Audits:** VMT conducts random quality audits on 10% of completed repairs, focusing on new vendors or those with lower performance scores.
2.  **Triggered Audits:** Audits are triggered by:
    *   Claimant complaints regarding repair quality.
    *   Repeated estimate discrepancies.
    *   Significant deviations from repair standards.
3.  **Audit Process:** An independent inspector (internal or third-party) assesses the repair quality against industry standards, approved estimates, and claimant expectations. Findings are recorded in the VMS.

### 6.3. Performance Reviews

1.  **Quarterly Reviews:** VMT conducts quarterly performance reviews with Tier 1 (high volume/critical) vendors.
2.  **Annual Reviews:** All other active AVL vendors receive annual performance reviews.
3.  Reviews discuss KPI performance, quality audit results, any outstanding issues, and opportunities for improvement.

## 7. Invoice Processing and Payment

1.  **Final Invoice Submission:** Upon repair completion, the vendor submits a final invoice and completion report via the VMS.
2.  **Claim Adjuster Verification:** The Claim Adjuster verifies the completed work, often through claimant confirmation or photographic evidence, and compares the invoice against the approved estimate/work authorization.
3.  **Discrepancies:** Any discrepancies between the final invoice and the approved amount exceeding 5% must be reconciled with the vendor and documented.
4.  **Payment Authorization:** Approved invoices are forwarded for payment. Payment terms are Net 30 days from invoice approval.

## 8. Dispute Resolution

1.  **Initial Contact:** Any issues or disputes (e.g., repair quality, timeline delays, invoice discrepancies) are first raised with the assigned Claim Adjuster.
2.  **Internal Investigation:** The Claim Adjuster investigates the issue, gathers evidence, and attempts informal resolution with the vendor.
3.  **Escalation to VMT:** If unresolved within 5 business days, the dispute is escalated to the Vendor Management Team.
4.  **Formal Resolution:** VMT convenes discussions with the vendor, leveraging contractual terms (SLA), performance data, and audit findings to reach a formal resolution.
5.  **Sanctions:** Depending on the severity and frequency of disputes, sanctions may include:
    *   Verbal warning.
    *   Written warning.
    *   Temporary suspension of new assignments.
    *   Removal from AVL.

## 9. Vendor Offboarding

### 9.1. Triggers for Offboarding

*   **Consistent Underperformance:** Repeated failure to meet KPIs or address quality issues after formal warnings.
*   **Breach of Contract:** Violation of MSA or SLA terms.
*   **Irreparable Claimant Dissatisfaction:** Multiple severe claimant complaints.
*   **Business Cessation:** Vendor ceases operations.
*   **Voluntary Exit:** Vendor requests removal from AVL.
*   **Company Decision:** Strategic decision to consolidate vendors or change service providers.

### 9.2. Offboarding Process

1.  **Notification:** VMT provides written notification to the vendor, outlining the reason for offboarding and effective date (typically 30 days' notice unless severe breach).
2.  **Work Completion:** Vendor completes all active assignments. No new assignments are issued.
3.  **Final Payments:** All outstanding invoices for completed work are processed.
4.  **System Deactivation:** Vendor's access to the VMS is revoked.
5.  **Record Keeping:** All performance data, incident reports, and offboarding documentation are archived in the VMS for future reference.
