# SOP: Aerial Drone Inspection for Property Damage Assessment

## 1. Overview
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the process for planning, executing, and reporting aerial drone inspections for property damage assessments. The primary purpose is to ensure consistent, safe, and effective utilization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to gather visual evidence for insurance claims, enhance accuracy, and improve efficiency in damage assessment while adhering to all regulatory and safety standards.

## 2. Scope
This SOP applies to all field adjusters, inspection teams, and authorized personnel conducting aerial drone inspections on behalf of NexusSure Insurance for property damage claims. It covers pre-flight planning, on-site operations, data capture, post-flight review, and data submission. This SOP applies to residential and commercial properties, but excludes inspections requiring specialized equipment or permissions beyond standard FAA Part 107 regulations (e.g., hazardous materials sites, active construction zones without specific permits).

### 2.1 Inclusions
*   Roof damage assessments (hail, wind, tree impact)
*   Exterior structural damage assessments (walls, chimneys, foundations)
*   Large property overview (commercial complexes, agricultural properties)
*   Post-disaster rapid assessment
*   Documentation of property condition for baseline or before/after comparison

### 2.2 Exclusions
*   Interior property inspections
*   Inspections requiring direct physical contact or manual manipulation of property elements
*   Flights in restricted airspace without prior FAA authorization (e.g., Class B, C, D, E around airports)
*   Flights over public gatherings or moving vehicles without specific waivers

## 3. Definitions
*   **UAV:** Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, commonly known as a drone.
*   **Pilot in Command (PIC):** The individual responsible for the operation and safety of the drone during flight. Must hold a valid FAA Part 107 Remote Pilot Certificate.
*   **Visual Observer (VO):** An individual assisting the PIC by maintaining visual contact with the drone and surrounding airspace.
*   **FAA Part 107:** Federal Aviation Administration regulations governing the commercial operation of small UAVs (under 55 lbs).
*   **NOTAM:** Notice to Airmen, a notice filed with an aviation authority to alert aircraft pilots of potential hazards along a flight route or at a location that could affect the safety of the flight.
*   **KML File:** Keyhole Markup Language file used to display geographic data in mapping software.
*   **Orthomosaic:** A large, geo-referenced, high-resolution image created by stitching together multiple smaller images.
*   **POI:** Point of Interest.

## 4. Requirements and Criteria

### 4.1 Personnel Qualifications
*   All PICs must possess a current FAA Part 107 Remote Pilot Certificate.
*   All personnel involved in drone operations must complete NexusSure's internal drone safety and procedure training annually.
*   VOs must be briefed by the PIC on their responsibilities for each flight.

### 4.2 Equipment
*   Drones must be registered with the FAA, if required by weight.
*   All drones must pass a pre-flight system check as per manufacturer guidelines and NexusSure checklist (Appendix A).
*   Required equipment: Drone, remote controller, fully charged batteries (minimum 3), appropriate charging equipment, mobile device/tablet with flight planning software, emergency landing pad (optional but recommended), high-visibility vest.

### 4.3 Environmental Conditions
*   **Wind Speed:** Maximum sustained wind speed of 20 mph (32 km/h). Flights in higher winds require executive approval and specific drone capabilities.
*   **Precipitation:** No flights permitted during rain, snow, hail, or heavy fog.
*   **Visibility:** Minimum visibility of 3 statute miles (approx. 4.8 km) from the control station.
*   **Temperature:** Operations within manufacturer's specified temperature range, typically -10°C to 40°C (14°F to 104°F).

### 4.4 Flight Planning Criteria
*   **Airspace Review:** All flights must be planned using airspace awareness tools (e.g., B4UFLY, Airmap) to identify controlled airspace, temporary flight restrictions (TFRs), and other NOTAMs.
*   **LAANC Authorization:** If operating in controlled airspace requiring authorization, the PIC must obtain immediate or facility map authorization via LAANC (Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability) prior to flight.
*   **Property Boundary:** Flight path must not intentionally overfly adjacent properties without explicit written consent from property owners.
*   **Privacy:** Efforts must be made to minimize intrusiveness. Avoid flying directly over occupied windows or private areas where reasonable expectation of privacy exists, unless directly relevant to the claim.

## 5. Procedures for Aerial Drone Inspection

### 5.1 Pre-Flight Planning (Minimum 24 hours prior)
1.  **Claim Review:** Review claim details, policy information, adjuster notes, and any preliminary damage reports. Identify critical areas of interest (POIs).
2.  **Site Assessment (Remote):** Use satellite imagery (e.g., Google Maps, Nearmap) to identify potential hazards (power lines, tall trees, antennas), access points, and flight path limitations. Determine the property's proximity to schools, hospitals, or airports.
3.  **Airspace Check:** Utilize FAA-approved apps (e.g., B4UFLY, Airmap) to check airspace restrictions, NOTAMs, and TFRs. Obtain LAANC authorization if necessary, ensuring it's confirmed before departure to the site.
4.  **Weather Check:** Verify weather forecast for the proposed flight time. Confirm it meets the criteria in Section 4.3.
5.  **Battery Management:** Ensure all required drone batteries are fully charged and in good condition.
6.  **Equipment Preparation:** Pack all necessary equipment, including spare props, SD cards, and safety gear.
7.  **Briefing:** If a VO is present, conduct a pre-flight briefing covering roles, responsibilities, communication protocols, and emergency procedures.

### 5.2 On-Site Operations
1.  **Site Arrival & Safety Briefing:**
    *   Upon arrival, perform a quick visual inspection of the property and immediate surroundings for new or unseen hazards.
    *   Identify a safe takeoff/landing zone, clear of obstacles and away from public access.
    *   Inform property owner/occupant of drone operations and expected timeframe. Obtain verbal consent to fly over the property.
    *   Set up warning cones/barriers if operating in a populated area or near public access points.
2.  **Drone Setup & Pre-Flight Checklist (Appendix A):**
    *   Assemble drone, attach propellers, and insert charged battery.
    *   Power on drone and remote controller.
    *   Connect mobile device and launch flight planning software.
    *   Complete the Pre-Flight Checklist, including compass calibration if required by location.
    *   Verify GPS lock (minimum 8 satellites).
3.  **Flight Execution:**
    *   **Takeoff:** Announce "Clear Prop!" or similar before takeoff. Lift off slowly, maintaining visual contact.
    *   **Initial Hover Check:** Hover drone at 10-15 feet to verify stability, controls, and return-to-home (RTH) functionality.
    *   **Automated Flight (Preferred):** For comprehensive coverage, plan an automated grid or orbital mission using flight planning software. This ensures consistent altitude, overlap, and data quality.
        *   **Altitude:** Maintain an altitude that provides clear detail of damage while ensuring safety and adherence to FAA regulations (typically 50-100 feet AGL for roof inspections).
        *   **Overlap:** Ensure minimum 70% frontlap and 60% sidelap for orthomosaic generation.
    *   **Manual Flight (For POIs):** For specific points of interest not covered by automated plans (e.g., close-ups of specific damage), use manual control.
        *   **Maintain VLOS:** PIC must maintain Visual Line of Sight with the drone at all times. A VO can assist in this regard.
        *   **Photos/Videos:** Capture high-resolution still images and/or video footage of all damaged areas and overall property condition. Ensure clear focus and proper exposure.
        *   **360° Panorama:** Capture panoramas from key vantage points to provide contextual awareness.
    *   **Battery Monitoring:** Continuously monitor battery levels. Plan for battery changes, ensuring enough power for RTH or emergency landing.
    *   **Emergency Procedures:** In case of emergency (lost signal, flyaway, battery critical), execute pre-defined emergency protocols (e.g., RTH activated, emergency landing).

### 5.3 Post-Flight Procedures
1.  **Landing:** Execute a controlled landing in the designated safe zone.
2.  **Shutdown:** Power off drone and controller. Disassemble drone.
3.  **Data Download:** Immediately download all captured images and video footage from the drone's SD card to a secure NexusSure-issued device (e.g., laptop, encrypted tablet).
4.  **Data Verification:** Perform a quick visual check of the downloaded files to ensure completeness and quality (no blurry images, missing sections).
5.  **SD Card Management:** Format the SD card only after successful data transfer and verification.

### 5.4 Data Processing & Reporting
1.  **Upload to Processing Software:** Upload raw imagery to NexusSure's approved photogrammetry software (e.g., DroneDeploy, Pix4D) for orthomosaic generation, 3D modeling, and damage annotation.
2.  **Orthomosaic & 3D Model Generation:** Generate orthomosaic maps and 3D models of the inspected property.
3.  **Damage Annotation:** Using the processed data, annotate all identified damage, measuring dimensions and categorizing damage types.
4.  **Report Generation:** Compile a comprehensive Aerial Drone Inspection Report (Appendix B) including:
    *   Date and time of inspection
    *   Claim number and property address
    *   PIC name and FAA Part 107 certificate number
    *   Drone model used
    *   Weather conditions during flight
    *   Map of flight path (KML export)
    *   Orthomosaic images with damage annotations
    *   Key close-up images of damage
    *   Summary of findings and conclusions regarding damage causality (if discernable)
    *   Estimated repair dimensions (if applicable)
5.  **Data Archiving:** Upload the final report, raw images, processed orthomosaics, and 3D models to the designated NexusSure claims management system, linked to the specific claim file (Claim ID: [Claim_ID], Property Address: [Property_Address]).

## 6. Exceptions
*   **Controlled Airspace without LAANC:** In rare cases where LAANC authorization is unavailable or denied, and an inspection is deemed critical, special authorization from the FAA through a Part 107 waiver may be pursued. This must be approved by the Director of Claims Operations.
*   **Hazardous Conditions:** If on-site conditions (e.g., active fires, unstable structures) pose undue risk, the PIC has the authority to abort or postpone the mission, even if pre-flight checks were clear. Such decisions must be immediately reported to the claims manager.
*   **Privacy Concerns:** If a property owner/occupant explicitly denies consent for drone operations after arrival, the drone flight must be aborted. Alternative inspection methods must be utilized, and the denial documented in the claim file.

## 7. Examples

### Example 1: Hail Damage Assessment
*   **Scenario:** A residential property claim due to severe hail storm.
*   **Drone Use:** Automated grid flight plan over the roof at 75 ft AGL, with 80% frontlap and 70% sidelap. Additional manual flights to capture close-ups of specific hail impact marks on shingles, gutters, and siding.
*   **Output:** High-resolution orthomosaic revealing the extent of dimpling, fracturing, and granule loss across the entire roof surface, enabling precise quantification of damaged areas for repair estimates. Multiple high-detail images categorize different levels of hail damage.

### Example 2: Commercial Roof Leak Inspection
*   **Scenario:** Commercial complex experiencing a persistent roof leak in a large, flat roof section, difficult to access manually.
*   **Drone Use:** Thermal imaging drone (if available and certified) to identify temperature differentials indicative of trapped moisture or compromised insulation, followed by a visible light inspection for direct damage.
*   **Output:** Thermal imagery showing cold spots correlating with moisture intrusion, overlaid with visible light imagery pinpointing potential entry points such as compromised membrane seams or HVAC penetrations.
