# Standard Operating Procedure: Engaging External Investigators

## 1. Overview/Purpose
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the process for engaging external investigators for claim assessments deemed complex, suspicious, or beyond the scope of internal investigative capabilities. The purpose is to ensure efficient, compliant, and effective utilization of third-party investigative services to support accurate claim decisions, mitigate fraud, and manage financial risk.

## 2. Scope
This SOP applies to all Claims Adjusters, Claims Managers, and designated personnel involved in the processing and adjudication of claims across all insurance lines (e.g., auto, property, liability, worker's compensation). It covers the entire lifecycle of external investigator engagement, from initial identification of need to final report review and vendor payment.

### 2.1 Inclusions:
*   Claims requiring specialized expertise (e.g., forensic accounting, accident reconstruction, fire origin and cause).
*   Claims with suspected fraud (e.g., staged accidents, inflated damages, misrepresentation).
*   Claims involving sensitive or high-profile cases.
*   Claims where internal resources are insufficient or overextended.
*   Claims requiring surveillance or detailed background checks.

### 2.2 Exclusions:
*   Routine claim documentation or verification that can be performed by internal adjusters.
*   Services explicitly covered by other vendor agreements (e.g., standard appraisal services, medical peer reviews unless fraud is suspected).
*   Legal consultation (this is handled by the Legal Department via a separate process).

## 3. Definitions
*   **External Investigator:** A third-party individual or firm contracted to conduct investigations related to an insurance claim on behalf of the company.
*   **Claims Adjuster:** The company employee responsible for managing, evaluating, and settling insurance claims.
*   **Claims Manager:** The supervisor responsible for overseeing a team of Claims Adjusters and approving elevated actions.
*   **Fraud Flag:** An indicator within the Claims Management System (CMS) or based on adjuster observation suggesting potential fraudulent activity.
*   **Statement of Work (SOW):** A formal document detailing the specific tasks, objectives, deliverables, timelines, and costs for an external investigator engagement.
*   **Approved Vendor List:** A pre-qualified list of external investigation firms with whom the company has established contractual agreements and satisfactory service levels.

## 4. Criteria for Engagement
External investigators are to be engaged when one or more of the following criteria are met:

### 4.1 Suspicion of Fraud:
*   Inconsistent statements from claimants/witnesses.
*   Discrepancies in submitted documentation (e.g., medical records, repair invoices, income verification).
*   Prior history of suspicious claims for the claimant.
*   Unusual claim circumstances (e.g., rapid filing after policy inception, "coincidental" accidents).
*   Information from law enforcement or other third parties suggesting fraudulent activity.

### 4.2 Claim Complexity/Specialized Expertise Required:
*   Need for forensic analysis (e.g., fire, flood, collapse, cyber forensics).
*   Detailed accident reconstruction for severe injury or high-value vehicle cases.
*   Requires specialized surveillance or covert operations.
*   Involves complex business interruption calculations or inventory audits.
*   Large-scale catastrophe events overwhelming internal capacity.

### 4.3 Resource Constraints:
*   Internal investigative unit capacity is fully allocated.
*   Geographic limitations preventing internal staff from effective investigation.

## 5. Procedures for Engagement

### 5.1 Step 1: Initial Assessment by Claims Adjuster (Claim Owner)
1.  **Identify Need:** The Claims Adjuster identifies specific criteria (see Section 4) indicating the need for external investigative support.
2.  **Document Rationale:** Document the reasons for external engagement clearly in the Claims Management System (CMS) claim notes, citing specific observations, red flags, or complexity.
3.  **Propose Scope:** Draft a preliminary scope of work, outlining key objectives, specific questions to be answered, and desired deliverables (e.g., surveillance video, report on financial background, accident reconstruction findings).

### 5.2 Step 2: Management Review and Approval
1.  **Submit Request:** The Claims Adjuster submits the proposal and rationale to their direct Claims Manager for review.
2.  **Manager Review:** The Claims Manager reviews the submitted information, checking for compliance with this SOP, necessity, and cost-effectiveness. The manager may request further clarification or adjustments to the proposed scope.
3.  **Approve/Reject:**
    *   **Approval:** If approved, the Claims Manager will authorize the engagement. For engagements estimated over $5,000, a second-level approval from the Department Head or Senior Claims Manager is required.
    *   **Rejection:** If rejected, the manager will provide clear reasons and alternative instructions to the adjuster (e.g., pursue internal investigation, close claim).
4.  **Budget Code Assignment:** The Claims Manager provides the appropriate budget code for tracking investigator expenses.

### 5.3 Step 3: Vendor Selection and SOW Authorization
1.  **Vendor Selection:** The Claims Adjuster selects a qualified external investigator from the Approved Vendor List based on their specialization, track record, geographic coverage, and current availability. For new or unlisted vendors, a procurement review process (outside this SOP) must be initiated.
2.  **Request Proposal/Quote:** The Claims Adjuster contacts the selected vendor, provides the preliminary scope of work, and requests a detailed SOW including proposed methodology, estimated hours, rates, and total cost estimate.
3.  **Review SOW:** The Claims Adjuster reviews the vendor's SOW to ensure it aligns with the approved scope, budget, and company guidelines. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the vendor.
4.  **Formal Authorization:** Upon satisfaction with the SOW, the Claims Adjuster formally authorizes the vendor to commence work, usually via a signed SOW or a dedicated purchase order/service request system. This authorization must explicitly reference the claim number.

### 5.4 Step 4: Monitoring and Communication During Investigation
1.  **Initial Contact & Briefing:** The Claims Adjuster provides the investigator with all relevant claim documentation (e.g., police reports, statements, medical records) and a comprehensive briefing on the case.
2.  **Regular Updates:** The Claims Adjuster maintains regular communication with the external investigator to monitor progress, address any emerging issues, and provide additional information as needed. The frequency of updates should be specified in the SOW (e.g., weekly, bi-weekly).
3.  **Scope Revisions:** Any significant changes to the scope of work (e.g., extension of surveillance hours, additional forensic tests) must be pre-approved by the Claims Manager, following Step 2.

### 5.5 Step 5: Report Review and Actioning
1.  **Receipt of Report:** The external investigator submits a final report and any supporting evidence (e.g., photos, videos, forensic data) within the agreed-upon timeframe.
2.  **Adjuster Review:** The Claims Adjuster thoroughly reviews the report for completeness, accuracy, and clarity. They ensure all objectives outlined in the SOW have been met.
3.  **Manager Review (if applicable):** For significant findings or high-value claims, the Claims Manager also reviews the report.
4.  **Integrate Findings:** The findings from the external investigation are integrated into the overall claim assessment and used to inform the adjudication decision (e.g., denial, settlement, referral to SIU).
5.  **Document in CMS:** All reports and associated communication are uploaded and linked within the Claims Management System under the respective claim number. A summary of the findings and subsequent claim actions must be documented in the claim notes.

### 5.6 Step 6: Invoice Processing and Payment
1.  **Invoice Verification:** The Claims Adjuster verifies the external investigator's invoice against the approved SOW and actual services rendered. Any discrepancies must be reconciled with the vendor.
2.  **Payment Approval:** Once verified, the invoice is submitted for payment, following established company expense approval workflows.
3.  **Performance Feedback:** The Claims Adjuster (or Manager, if applicable) provides feedback on the investigator's performance, which may be recorded for vendor management purposes.

## 6. Evidence/Documentation
The following documents and records must be maintained in the Claims Management System for each external investigator engagement:
*   Detailed claim notes outlining rationale for engagement.
*   Approved Request for Investigation form (if applicable).
*   Draft and final Statement of Work (SOW) or Service Agreement.
*   Vendor proposals and quotes.
*   All communication with the external investigator.
*   Interim progress reports.
*   Final investigative report and all supporting evidence.
*   Approved invoices and payment records.

## 7. Timelines
*   **Manager Approval (Step 2):** Within 2 business days of adjuster request.
*   **Vendor SOW/Quote:** Within 3 business days of request from adjuster.
*   **SOW Authorization (Step 3):** Within 1 business day of SOW receipt and review.
*   **Investigator Report Submission:** As per agreed timeline in SOW (typically 1-4 weeks, depending on complexity).
*   **Adjuster Report Review (Step 5):** Within 3 business days of report receipt.
*   **Invoice Processing (Step 6):** Within 5 business days of verified invoice receipt.

## 8. Exceptions
*   **Emergency Engagements:** In urgent situations (e.g., perishable evidence, immediate surveillance required), verbal approval from a Claims Manager or Department Head may precede formal written SOW authorization, provided written documentation follows within 24 hours. These instances must be highly justified.
*   **New Vendor Onboarding:** If a specialized service is required from a vendor not on the Approved Vendor List, the Claims Manager must escalate the request to the Procurement Department for expedited onboarding and due diligence. This process should not impede critical claim investigation but acknowledges additional risk.
*   **Cost Overruns:** Any anticipated cost overruns exceeding 10% of the initial SOW estimate must be immediately reported to the Claims Manager and require re-approval. Work should pause on the affected activities until re-approval is granted, unless severe claim prejudice would result.

## 9. Decision Logic for Claim Outcome Modifciation based on Investigator Findings
The findings from external investigations serve as critical evidence in the claim decision-making process.

### 9.1 Claim Denial:
*   If the investigator's report provides clear, irrefutable evidence of misrepresentation, material omission, or direct fraud that directly impacts the validity of the claim or coverage.
*   Example: Surveillance video disproves injury claims, forensic analysis proves arson by the insured, or detailed background check reveals prior history of staged accidents not disclosed.

### 9.2 Partial Denial/Adjustment:
*   If the investigation reveals only a portion of the claim is fraudulent or exaggerated, or if specific components are disproven.
*   Example: Repair estimates are inflated based on investigator's findings, or some medical treatments are deemed unrelated to the covered event.

### 9.3 Referral to Special Investigations Unit (SIU):
*   If the investigator's findings strongly suggest a pattern of fraud, organized crime involvement, or require further criminal investigation.
*   Example: Identification of multiple fraudulent claimants linked to the same "accident factory" or evidence of collusion from service providers.

### 9.4 Claim Payout/Settlement:
*   If the investigation definitively disproves initial suspicions of fraud, clarifies complex liability, or substantiates the claimant's narrative, leading to a fair and accurate settlement.
*   Example: Accident reconstruction report definitively assigns fault away from the insured, or forensic audit confirms business interruption losses without fraud.

## 10. Examples

### 10.1 Example Case: Suspected Auto Fraud
*   **Claim Type:** Auto Liability (BI & PD)
*   **Initial Observation:** Claimant reports vague soft tissue injuries after a low-impact rear-end collision. Vehicle damage is minimal. Claimant is represented by a law firm known for "accident mill" cases.
*   **Adjuster's Action:** Flags "suspicious claim," documents inconsistencies, and proposes surveillance and background check for the claimant.
*   **Manager Approval:** Approved for $3,000 budget for 3 days of surveillance and a basic background check.
*   **Investigator Engagement:** ABC Investigations hired. SOW details 3 days of surveillance and a background check.
*   **Findings:** Surveillance video shows claimant performing strenuous activities (lifting heavy boxes, jogging) conflicting with reported injuries. Background check reveals multiple prior claims with similar injury types.
*   **Decision:** Partial denial on medical portion of claim, referral to SIU for further review. Settlement offer for vehicle damage only.

### 10.2 Example Case: Complex Property Damage
*   **Claim Type:** Commercial Property (Fire)
*   **Initial Observation:** Fire at a small manufacturing plant. Cause is unclear. Insured claims significant inventory loss, but inventory records are incomplete.
*   **Adjuster's Action:** Proposes engaging a forensic fire investigator and a forensic accountant.
*   **Manager Approval:** Approved for $15,000 budget.
*   **Investigator Engagement:** Forensic Fire Solutions engaged for origin and cause, and AuditLink Inc. for inventory and business interruption.
*   **Findings:** Fire investigator determines accidental electrical cause, ruling out arson. Forensic accountant reconstructs inventory, finding loss is 20% lower than initially claimed due to accounting errors, not fraud.
*   **Decision:** Claim payout adjusted to reflect actual loss determined by forensic accountant. No evidence of fraud.
