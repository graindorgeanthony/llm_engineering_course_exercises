# Standard Operating Procedure: Releasing Information to Third Parties

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the authorized process and necessary safeguards for releasing claim-related information to external third parties, including attorneys, medical providers, law enforcement, and other authorized entities. The purpose is to ensure that all information releases comply with applicable laws and regulations (e.g., HIPAA, state privacy laws), company policies, and claimant privacy rights, while efficiently facilitating claim resolution. Adherence to this SOP protects claimant confidentiality and mitigates legal and reputational risks to the company.

## 2. Scope

This SOP applies to all employees, contractors, and agents of [Company Name] who may be involved in the handling, processing, or releasing of claimant information within any department, including Claims, Legal, Underwriting, and Customer Service.

### 2.1. Inclusions

*   Release of medical records, billing statements, police reports, accident reports, declarations of coverage, claim summaries, and correspondence.
*   Information released in response to subpoenas, court orders, or administrative requests.
*   Information released based on claimant authorizations.
*   Information released to appointed representatives (e.g., attorneys, guardians).

### 2.2. Exclusions

*   Access to information by internal company departments for legitimate business purposes (governed by internal access policies).
*   Information exchanges with direct vendors or business associates under existing Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) where such exchanges are explicitly covered without individual claimant consent requirements. For specific BAA requirements, refer to the "Vendor Management Policy."

## 3. Definitions

*   **Claimant:** The individual who has submitted a claim for benefits or services.
*   **Protected Health Information (PHI):** Individually identifiable health information as defined by HIPAA.
*   **Personally Identifiable Information (PII):** Information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual, such as name, social security number, date of birth, medical records.
*   **Third Party:** Any individual or entity external to [Company Name] who is not the claimant or a direct business associate under a BAA. Examples include attorneys, medical providers, law enforcement, courts, government agencies, employers, and family members.
*   **Authorization:** A written, signed permission from the claimant or their legally authorized representative allowing the release of specific information.
*   **Subpoena/Court Order:** A legal document issued by a court or administrative body compelling the production of documents or testimony.
*   **Redaction:** The process of obscuring or removing sensitive or privileged information from a document before its release.

## 4. General Principles for Information Release

All information releases must adhere to the following principles:

1.  **Legal Basis:** Information must only be released if there is a legal or regulatory requirement, a valid claimant authorization, or a legitimate legal interest (e.g., litigation).
2.  **Minimum Necessary Rule:** Only the minimum amount of information necessary to fulfill the request or purpose should be disclosed.
3.  **Verification:** The identity and authority of the requesting third party must be verified prior to any release.
4.  **Documentation:** All requests and releases of information must be thoroughly documented in the claim file.
5.  **Security:** Information must be transmitted securely, using encrypted channels for electronic data or certified mail for physical documents.

## 5. Procedures for Releasing Information

### 5.1. Step 1: Receiving the Request

1.  **Identify Request:** Review incoming requests (mail, fax, email, phone) for claimant information.
2.  **Log Request:** Document the request in the claim management system (CMS) under the "Information Release Log" module, including:
    *   Date of request
    *   Requesting party (name, organization, contact info)
    *   Claimant name and claim number
    *   Type of information requested (e.g., medical records, billing statements)
    *   Stated purpose of the request
    *   Method of request receipt (e.g., email, fax, subpoena)

### 5.2. Step 2: Validating the Request and Authority

All requests for information must be validated against one of the following criteria:

#### 5.2.1. Valid Claimant Authorization

1.  **Authorization Requirements:** Examine the authorization form for the following mandatory elements:
    *   Written and signed by the claimant (or legal representative).
    *   Dated (must be current, generally within 12 months if not specified).
    *   Specific about the information to be disclosed (e.g., "all medical records related to claim #12345 from 01/01/2022 to 12/31/2022").
    *   Specific about the party authorized to disclose information ([Company Name]).
    *   Specific about the party authorized to receive information.
    *   Clear statement regarding the claimant's right to revoke the authorization.
    *   Clear statement regarding potential for re-disclosure by the recipient.
2.  **Verification:** If the authorization is unclear, incomplete, or suspect, contact the claimant or their representative for clarification or a new authorization.
3.  **Scope Matching:** Ensure the requested information falls within the scope of the authorization. If not, only release authorized information.

#### 5.2.2. Valid Subpoena or Court Order

1.  **Forward to Legal:** Immediately forward all subpoenas, court orders, or warrants to the Legal Department within **24 hours** of receipt. Do NOT release any information before Legal Department review.
2.  **Legal Review:** The Legal Department will:
    *   Verify the authenticity and legal validity of the subpoena/order.
    *   Determine the scope of required disclosure and identify any grounds for objection (e.g., privilege, undue burden).
    *   Advise the claims handler on what information to release and any necessary redactions.
    *   Determine if the claimant needs to be notified (e.g., HIPAA requirements for health information).
3.  **Compliance:** Claims handlers must strictly follow the Legal Department's instructions.

#### 5.2.3. Statutory or Regulatory Requirement

1.  **Identify Mandate:** Verify if a specific law or regulation mandates the release of information without claimant consent (e.g., workers' compensation reporting, fraud investigations, public health activities).
2.  **Consult Legal/Compliance:** If unsure, consult the Legal or Compliance Department to confirm the statutory requirement and scope of permissible disclosure.
3.  **Minimum Necessary:** Even when legally mandated, release only the minimum necessary information required by the statute.

#### 5.2.4. Other Legitimate Legal Interest (e.g., Litigation)

1.  **Internal Legal Counsel:** For requests related to active litigation involving the company, claims handlers must consult with internal legal counsel or the external defense counsel assigned to the case.
2.  **Claimant Notification:** If information is released under a legal interest (e.g., to defend the company in a lawsuit where the claimant is a party), record notification to the claimant or their attorney, if required.

## 5.3. Step 3: Preparing Information for Release

1.  **Gather Relevant Documents:** Collect all documents matching the validated request and scope.
2.  **Review and Redact:**
    *   Carefully review every page of the documents.
    *   **Redact any PHI or PII that is outside the scope of the authorization/subpoena/legal basis.**
    *   **Redact sensitive information not explicitly requested or required,** such as:
        *   Another individual's PHI/PII (e.g., family members' medical info).
        *   Psychotherapy notes (require specific authorization).
        *   Substance abuse treatment records (governed by 42 CFR Part 2).
        *   Proprietary company information not relevant to the claim.
        *   Privileged communications (e.g., attorney-client privilege, work product).
    *   Use approved redaction software or a permanent marker for physical documents. Ensure redaction is irreversible.
3.  **Organize and Index:** Arrange documents chronologically or by type. For large releases, create a cover sheet itemizing the contents.
4.  **Count Pages:** Document the total number of pages being released.

## 5.4. Step 4: Secure Transmission of Information

1.  **Method of Transmission:**
    *   **Secure Electronic:** Encrypted email ([Company Name] approved encryption software), secure file transfer portal. **Never send PHI/PII via unencrypted email.**
    *   **Physical Mail:** Use certified mail with return receipt requested, or a reputable courier service that provides tracking.
    *   **Fax:** Only to a pre-verified, secure fax number, with a cover sheet including a confidentiality notice. Verify receipt by calling the recipient.
2.  **Verification of Recipient:** Before transmitting, confirm the recipient's identity and contact information matches the original request.
3.  **Confidentiality Notice:** Include a confidentiality or disclaimer notice on all faxes, emails, or cover sheets clearly stating that the information is confidential and legally privileged, and for the sole use of the intended recipient.

## 5.5. Step 5: Documenting the Release

1.  **Update Information Release Log:**
    *   Date of release
    *   Method of transmission
    *   Recipient name and organization
    *   Description of information released (e.g., "50 pages of medical records from Dr. Smith, 01/01/2022-12/31/2022")
    *   Basis for release (e.g., "Claimant Authorization dated 10/01/2023", "Court Order #2023-CV-00123")
    *   Employee performing the release
2.  **Scan/Upload:** Scan a copy of the released documents (or a representative sample if exceptionally large) and the authorization/subpoena into the claim file.
3.  **Confirmation of Receipt:** File any return receipts (certified mail) or delivery confirmations (courier, secure portal).

## 6. Exceptions

*   **Emergencies:** In life-threatening emergencies, information may be released to medical personnel to treat the claimant without prior authorization. Such releases must be immediately documented, and the Compliance Department notified within **2 hours**. A follow-up authorization should be sought as soon as practicable.
*   **Law Enforcement (Non-Subpoena):** For non-subpoena law enforcement requests, refer to the "Law Enforcement Interaction Policy" and obtain Legal Department approval. Generally, releases without a warrant or subpoena are limited to specific circumstances (e.g., identifying a suspect or victim).

## 7. Evidence/Documentation

*   Signed Claimant Authorization forms (physical or electronic).
*   Copies of subpoenas, court orders, warrants.
*   Internal Legal Department advisories or approvals.
*   Information Release Log entries within the CMS.
*   Confirmation of delivery (e.g., certified mail receipts, secure portal logs).
*   Copies of redacted documents (where applicable).

## 8. Timelines

*   **Subpoena/Court Order Review:** Immediate forwarding to Legal; Legal review within 48-72 hours.
*   **Response to Valid Requests (with Authorization/Legal Basis):** Within 5-10 business days of receiving all necessary validation. Complex requests may require more time, and the requester should be notified.
*   **Emergency Releases:** Immediate action, followed by documentation and notification within 2 hours.

## 9. Training and Compliance

All employees involved in handling claimant information are required to complete annual training on privacy regulations (HIPAA, state laws) and this SOP. Non-compliance with this SOP may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination, and potential legal penalties for the company.
