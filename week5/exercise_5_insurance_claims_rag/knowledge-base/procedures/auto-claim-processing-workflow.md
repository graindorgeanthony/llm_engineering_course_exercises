# Workflow: Auto Claim Processing

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the standard operating procedure (SOP) for processing auto insurance claims from initial notification of loss (FNOL) through to final settlement. Its purpose is to ensure consistent, efficient, and accurate handling of all standard auto claims, minimizing processing time and maximizing customer satisfaction. This workflow applies to claims initiated by policyholders of comprehensive, collision, liability, and uninsured/underinsured motorist coverages.

## 2. Scope

This SOP applies to all claims adjusters, claims support staff, and supervisors involved in the processing of standard auto insurance claims within [Company Name]. It covers claims filed for incidents occurring within [Service Area/States] and under policies issued by [Company Name].

**Exclusions:**
*   Complex claims involving severe bodily injury, multiple vehicles (e.g., 3+ vehicles), or ambiguous liability where specialized investigation or legal counsel is required.
*   Fraudulent claims (these are routed to the Special Investigation Unit - SIU).
*   Claims involving commercial auto policies, which follow a separate workflow.
*   Claims related to roadside assistance only, not involving vehicle damage or personal injury.

## 3. Definitions

*   **FNOL (First Notice of Loss):** The initial report of a claim by the policyholder or an involved party.
*   **Claim Adjuster (CA):** An employee responsible for investigating, negotiating, and settling insurance claims.
*   **Policyholder:** The individual or entity insured under an insurance policy.
*   **Third-Party:** An individual or entity involved in an incident with the policyholder but not insured by [Company Name].
*   **Estimate:** A detailed calculation of the cost to repair damaged property or the value of a totaled vehicle.
*   **Subrogation:** The process by which an insurance company pursues a third party responsible for an accident to recover amounts paid to its policyholder.
*   **Total Loss:** When the cost of repairing a damaged vehicle exceeds a predefined percentage of its actual cash value (ACV) or when repair is impractical/unsafe.
*   **Actual Cash Value (ACV):** The fair market value of property at the time of loss, considering depreciation.

## 4. Main Content: Auto Claim Processing Workflow

The following steps detail the complete auto claim processing workflow.

### 4.1. Step 1: Claim Intake (FNOL)

**Purpose:** To capture initial claim details and assign a claim number.

*   **Action:**
    1.  **Receive FNOL:** Policyholder (or authorized representative/agent) reports a loss via phone, online portal, or mobile app.
    2.  **Gather Initial Information:** Collect date/time of loss, location, description of incident, involved parties' contact info (if any), policy number, vehicle details (make, model, VIN), and initial damage assessment.
    3.  **Create Claim Record:** Input all FNOL data into the Claims Management System (CMS).
    4.  **Assign Claim Number:** CMS automatically generates a unique claim number.
    5.  **Initial Policy Verification:** System automatically verifies policy status (active/inactive) and coverage limits for the reported loss type.
    6.  **Assign to Adjuster:** Based on incident geography, claim type, and adjuster workload, the claim is automatically assigned to a primary Claim Adjuster (CA). In case of system unavailability, manual assignment by a supervisor is required.

*   **Evidence/Documentation:** FNOL recording/transcript, CMS claim record with initial details.
*   **Timelines:** Within 1 hour of FNOL receipt.

### 4.2. Step 2: Initial Contact & Setup

**Purpose:** To establish communication, explain the claims process, and obtain necessary authorizations.

*   **Action:**
    1.  **CA Contacts Policyholder:** Within 24 business hours of assignment, the CA contacts the policyholder to acknowledge claim receipt, introduce themselves, explain the claim process, and answer initial questions.
    2.  **Obtain Required Forms:** CA secures a signed Proof of Loss statement and authorization for medical records release (if bodily injury is reported) and vehicle inspection.
    3.  **Confirm Details:** CA reviews and confirms all FNOL details, correcting any discrepancies.
    4.  **Explain Coverage:** Clearly explain applicable coverages, deductibles, and any potential limitations.
    5.  **Advise on Next Steps:** Inform policyholder about the vehicle inspection process and expected timelines.

*   **Requirements/Criteria:** Policyholder acknowledgment of process, signed authorizations.
*   **Timelines:** Initial contact within 1 business day of assignment. Forms to be returned within 3 business days.

### 4.3. Step 3: Investigation & Document Gathering

**Purpose:** To gather facts, determine liability, and assess damages.

*   **Action:**
    1.  **Vehicle Inspection & Estimate:**
        *   **Standard Method:** Policyholder takes vehicle to an approved repair facility for an estimate, or CA schedules a field inspection (for complex or high-value claims).
        *   **Photo Estimate:** For minor damages, policyholder submits photos via app for AI-driven estimate or desk review.
        *   **Damage Assessment:** CA reviews "Vehicle Damage Report" (VDR) or estimate for accuracy, ensures all damage is related to the incident, and confirms repair feasibility.
    2.  **Liability Determination:**
        *   **Collect Police Report:** Request and review official police report (if available).
        *   **Obtain Witness Statements:** If applicable, contact witnesses and record statements.
        *   **Gather Photos/Videos:** Request any photos or videos from policyholder or involved parties.
        *   **Review Policy Language:** Confirm liability coverage applies based on policy terms and conditions.
        *   **Decision Logic:** Based on evidence, assign fault (100% Policyholder, 100% Third-Party, or shared liability, e.g., 50/50). If liability is unclear, escalate to a supervisor for review.
    3.  **Medical Records (if applicable):** If bodily injury is reported, CA obtains authorized medical records and bills for review.
    4.  **Confirm Subrogation Potential:** If the third party is at fault, identify potential for subrogation.

*   **Evidence/Documentation:** VDR/Estimate, police report, witness statements, policy declaration page, medical records (if BI).
*   **Timelines:** Vehicle inspection scheduled within 2 business days of request. Liability determination within 5 business days of receiving all documentation.

### 4.4. Step 4: Damage Evaluation & Settlement Calculation

**Purpose:** To determine the financial value of the loss (vehicle repair/replacement, medical expenses).

*   **Action:**
    1.  **Repair vs. Total Loss Analysis:**
        *   **Decision Criteria:** If repair estimate exceeds 75% of vehicle's ACV (or state-specific threshold), classify as "Total Loss." Otherwise, proceed with repair.
        *   **Total Loss Valuation:** For total losses, determine ACV using industry databases (e.g., CCC One, Audatex, Mitchell) and local market conditions. Adjust for vehicle condition, mileage, and options.
    2.  **Repair Cost Negotiation:** For repairs, CA negotiates with repair shops on estimate if discrepancies occur, ensuring fair and reasonable costs.
    3.  **Medical Expense Review (if applicable):** CA reviews medical bills against standard rates and policy limits.
    4.  **Calculate Settlement Amount:** Finalize the amount to be paid, deducting applicable deductibles, depreciation, and adjusting for shared liability.

*   **Requirements/Criteria:** Repair estimate adherence to standard labor rates, ACV documentation.
*   **Decision Logic:** Total loss threshold is `Repair Estimate > 75% of ACV`.
*   **Timelines:** Within 3 business days of completing investigation documentation.

### 4.5. Step 5: Settlement & Payout

**Purpose:** To finalize the claim and disburse payment to the appropriate parties.

*   **Action:**
    1.  **Present Offer:** CA presents the detailed settlement offer to the policyholder (and third party, if applicable).
    2.  **Negotiation (if necessary):** If the offer is disputed, CA engages in further discussion, providing justification for the settlement amount. escalate to supervisor for approval if adjustments outside standard parameters are requested.
    3.  **Obtain Release:** Policyholder (and/or lienholder for total loss) signs a Release of Claims form, acknowledging acceptance of the settlement.
    4.  **Disburse Payment:**
        *   **Repair Claims:** Payment made directly to the repair shop or policyholder upon completion of repairs and receipt of final invoice.
        *   **Total Loss:** Payment made to the policyholder and lienholder (if applicable).
        *   **Medical Claims:** Payment made directly to medical providers or policyholder.
    5.  **Update CMS:** Record final settlement amount, payment date, and method in CMS.

*   **Evidence/Documentation:** Settlement agreement, Release of Claims form, payment receipts/proof of transfer.
*   **Timelines:** Payment disbursed within 48 hours of signed release and receipt of all necessary documentation.

### 4.6. Step 6: Claim Closing & Subrogation

**Purpose:** To officially close the claim record and initiate subrogation if applicable.

*   **Action:**
    1.  **Claim Closure:** Once all payments are made and documentation is complete, the CA closes the claim in CMS.
    2.  **Subrogation Initiation:** If subrogation potential was identified (third-party fault), the claim is automatically flagged and routed to the Subrogation Department for recovery efforts.
    3.  **Documentation Archiving:** All claim-related documents are digitally archived according to company retention policies.

*   **Requirements/Criteria:** All benefits paid, all documentation received and verified.
*   **Timelines:** Claim closed within 3 business days of final payment. Subrogation referral within 24 hours of claim closure.

## 5. Exceptions

*   **Policy Coverage Disputes:** If there's a dispute regarding policy coverage, the claim is escalated to Claims Supervisor and Underwriting for review within 24 hours. The policyholder is informed of the delay.
*   **Fraud Suspicion:** Any claim exhibiting indicators of fraud (e.g., suspicious loss details, previous fraud history, excessive damage inconsistent with reported incident) is immediately referred to the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) with all supporting evidence. Processing is halted until SIU review.
*   **Bodily Injury Claims Exceeding Standard Limits:** Claims where estimated medical expenses or pain and suffering exceed $25,000 are immediately escalated to a Senior Claims Adjuster or Claims Manager for specialized handling due to increased complexity and potential litigation.
*   **Catastrophic Events:** During widespread catastrophic events (e.g., hurricanes, floods), standard timelines may be extended. Communication regarding revised timelines will be issued company-wide.

## 6. Examples
