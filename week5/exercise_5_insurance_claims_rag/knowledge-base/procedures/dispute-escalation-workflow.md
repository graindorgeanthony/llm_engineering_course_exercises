# Workflow: Claim Dispute Escalation

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the standard operating procedure (SOP) for escalating a claim dispute that cannot be resolved at the initial agent level. Its purpose is to ensure timely and consistent handling of complex or contentious claims, providing a clear path for resolution and maintaining customer satisfaction while adhering to company policies and regulatory requirements.

## 2. Scope

This workflow applies to all customer claims (e.g., insurance, warranty, service, billing) that have been formally disputed by the claimant and where the initial claim agent has exhausted standard resolution protocols without success. This includes disputes regarding claim denial, payment amount, service fulfillment, or interpretation of policy terms.

It covers internal escalation to higher management and outlines trigger points for potential external resolution.

**Exclusions:**
*   Initial claim submission and standard processing (prior to dispute).
*   Fraud investigation procedures (which are covered under a separate SOP).
*   Legal arbitration or litigation procedures initiated by external counsel, unless specifically advised by Legal Department.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Claimant:** The individual or entity submitting a claim.
*   **Claim Agent:** The initial point of contact responsible for processing and resolving claims.
*   **Dispute:** A formal disagreement expressed by the claimant regarding a claim outcome (e.g., denial, amount, terms).
*   **Level 1 Escalation:** Referral to a Team Lead or Supervisor.
*   **Level 2 Escalation:** Referral to a Department Manager or Senior Claims Analyst.
*   **Executive Review:** Referral to a Director or VP-level executive.
*   **SME (Subject Matter Expert):** An individual with specialized knowledge in a specific policy, product, or regulatory area.
*   **Resolution Specialist:** A designated individual or team focused on complex claim resolution.

## 4. Claim Dispute Escalation Procedure

The escalation process is tiered to ensure appropriate levels of review and decision-making.

### 4.1 Initial Agent Resolution Attempt (Pre-Escalation)

1.  **Acknowledge Dispute:** Upon receiving a formal dispute, the Claim Agent must acknowledge receipt within 1 business day.
2.  **Review Claim & Policy:** Agent thoroughly re-reviews the claim details, supporting documentation, relevant policies (e.g., Policy #PN12345, Contract #CX67890), and previous communication logs.
3.  **Gather Additional Information (if needed):** Agent contacts claimant or relevant internal departments (e.g., Underwriting, Sales, Legal) to gather any missing information that could clarify the dispute.
4.  **Re-evaluate Decision:** Agent re-evaluates the claim decision based on all available information and policy terms, considering any new evidence provided by the claimant.
5.  **Communicate Outcome (Attempt 1):** Agent communicates the re-evaluated decision clearly to the claimant, explaining the rationale and referencing specific policy sections (e.g., Clause 3.a - Eligibility Criteria, Section 5.b - Exclusions). If the initial decision stands, offer a clear explanation why.
6.  **Resolution Status Update:** Update the claim management system (e.g., "ClaimShield v4.1") with a detailed log of all actions, communications, and decision rationale. Set dispute status to "Under Review - Agent."

### 4.2 Level 1 Escalation: Team Lead/Supervisor Review

If the claimant remains dissatisfied after the initial agent's re-evaluation (Step 4.1.5) and explicitly requests further review, the Claim Agent MUST escalate to a Team Lead/Supervisor.

1.  **Agent Action:**
    *   Inform claimant of the escalation to a Team Lead/Supervisor within 1 business day.
    *   Update claim status to "Escalated - L1" in the claim management system.
    *   Prepare a comprehensive "Dispute Summary Report" (Template: `DISPUTE-L1-FORM-V2.pdf`) including:
        *   Claimant Name, Policy/Claim Number, Date of Dispute.
        *   Summary of original claim and decision.
        *   Claimant's specific reasons for dispute.
        *   Agent's actions and justifications.
        *   Relevant policy sections.
        *   Any unresolved questions or areas of ambiguity.
2.  **Team Lead/Supervisor Action:**
    *   Review the "Dispute Summary Report" and all associated claim documentation within 2 business days of receipt.
    *   Conduct a direct review of the policy terms relevant to the dispute.
    *   Interview the Claim Agent for additional context.
    *   May contact the claimant directly to understand their perspective.
    *   Make an independent decision or recommend a resolution path.
    *   Communicate decision (or recommendation) to the Claim Agent for execution, or directly to the claimant if deemed appropriate by the Team Lead/Supervisor.
    *   Update claim status in the system, detailing findings and decision.

### 4.3 Level 2 Escalation: Department Manager/Senior Claims Analyst Review

If the dispute is not resolved at Level 1, or if the claim involves a monetary threshold exceeding $5,000, or if there is potential for significant reputational risk as assessed by the Team Lead, the dispute MUST be escalated to a Department Manager or Senior Claims Analyst.

1.  **Team Lead/Supervisor Action:**
    *   Inform claimant of the Level 2 escalation within 1 business day.
    *   Update claim status to "Escalated - L2."
    *   Prepare an "Advanced Dispute Review Packet" (Template: `ADR-PACKET-V1.docx`) including:
        *   All documents from the Level 1 escalation.
        *   Team Lead's findings and rationale.
        *   Specific points of contention still requiring resolution.
2.  **Department Manager/Senior Claims Analyst Action:**
    *   Review the "Advanced Dispute Review Packet" and conduct a thorough analysis within 3 business days of receipt.
    *   Consult with relevant SMEs (e.g., Legal, Underwriting, Product Development) if the dispute involves complex legal interpretation, new product features, or an ambiguous policy clause.
    *   May conduct a direct conference call with the claimant.
    *   Make a final departmental decision, outlining comprehensive rationale.
    *   Communicate final decision to the claimant in writing (email or letter), with a copy to the Claim Agent and Team Lead. This communication must clearly state that this is the final decision at the departmental level and inform them of further options (e.g., Executive Review, external arbitration).
    *   Update claim status to "Resolved - L2" or "Escalated - Executive" as appropriate, detailing the decision and any actions taken.

### 4.4 Executive Review / Office of the President

This level of escalation is reserved for disputes that:
*   Have exhausted Level 1 and Level 2 reviews without resolution.
*   Involve a monetary threshold exceeding $15,000.
*   Pose significant regulatory or public relations risk, as determined by the Department Manager.
*   Are flagged by the Department Manager for direct executive attention.

1.  **Department Manager Action:**
    *   Inform claimant of the Executive Review within 1 business day.
    *   Update claim status to "Escalated - Executive."
    *   Prepare an "Executive Dispute Brief" (Template: `EXEC-DISP-BRIEF-V1.pptx` or a concise memo) summarizing the entire case, including:
        *   Chronology of dispute and previous reviews.
        *   Final recommendation from the Department Manager.
        *   Potential broader implications.
        *   Any legal or compliance advice received.
2.  **Executive Action (Director/VP Level):**
    *   Review the "Executive Dispute Brief" and key supporting documents within 5 business days of receipt.
    *   May convene a cross-functional meeting if necessary.
    *   Makes a final, binding company decision.
    *   Communicates the final decision directly to the claimant, typically in writing (formal letter via certified mail), with copies to all relevant internal parties. This letter will clearly state this is the COMPANY'S FINAL DECISION and outline any available external resolution options (e.g., regulatory bodies, ombudsman, arbitration - if applicable).
    *   Update claim status to "Resolved - Executive" or "External Referral," detailing the final decision and rationale.

## 5. Decision Logic

*   **When to Escalate to L1:** Claimant dissatisfaction after 4.1.5, requiring supervisory review.
*   **When to Escalate to L2:** Unresolved after L1 review, or monetary threshold > $5,000, or assessed reputational risk.
*   **When to Escalate to Executive:** Unresolved after L2 review, or monetary threshold > $15,000, or significant regulatory/PR risk.
*   **Precedence:** Policy terms > Regulatory Requirements > Executive Directive.

## 6. Evidence/Documentation Requirements

For every escalation level, the following documentation is required:

*   **Claim File:** Complete digital claim file (e.g., in ClaimShield v4.1).
*   **Communication Logs:** All written and recorded (if applicable) communications with the claimant.
*   **Policy Documents:** Specific contract and policy documents relevant to the claim.
*   **Internal Notes:** Detailed notes from each reviewer level (Agent, Team Lead, Manager) detailing their analysis, findings, and decisions.
*   **Dispute Summary Report (L1):** As per Section 4.2.
*   **Advanced Dispute Review Packet (L2):** As per Section 4.3.
*   **Executive Dispute Brief (Executive):** As per Section 4.4.
*   **SME Consultations:** Records of discussions or advice from Legal, Underwriting, etc.

## 7. Timelines

| Stage                             | Action By                      | Standard Timeline (from receipt at stage) |
| :-------------------------------- | :----------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| Acknowledge Dispute               | Claim Agent                    | 1 business day                            |

| L1 Review & Decision              | Team Lead/Supervisor           | 2 business days                           |
| L2 Escalation Prep                | Team Lead/Supervisor           | 1 business day                            |
| L2 Review & Decision              | Dept Manager/Sr. Claims Analyst | 3 business days                           |
| Executive Escalation Prep         | Dept Manager                   | 1 business day                            |
| Executive Review & Decision       | Executive (Director/VP)        | 5 business days                           |

**Note:** Total maximum internal resolution time from initial agent notification usually targets 20 business days for complex cases without external referral.

## 8. Exceptions

*   **Imminent Litigation:** If a legal threat is made by the claimant or their counsel, the case must be immediately referred to the Legal Department, bypassing standard escalation tiers. The Legal Department will then advise on the appropriate next steps.
*   **Regulatory Inquiry:** If a dispute simultaneously involves a formal inquiry from a regulatory body (e.g., State Insurance Commissioner), the case must be immediately escalated to the Department Manager AND the Compliance Officer for guidance.
*   **Claimant Grievance Office:** For cases specifically submitted to the company's "Office of Claimant Grievances," these cases follow a separate, dedicated Resolution Specialist workflow, typically directly reporting to a VP-level executive. They do not follow the standard L1/L2 escalation path outlined here.
