Should I approve this claim for the full appraised value?", "keywords": ["diamond ring", "mysterious disappearance", "appraisal", "jewelry", "36 months", "worldwide coverage"], "reference_answer": "The claim should be refused for the full appraised value because the professional appraisal provided is outdated. For items valued at $5,000 or more, the policy requires a current professional appraisal dated within the last 36 months; an appraisal from four years ago (48 months) does not meet this requirement. Additionally, while 'mysterious disappearance' is a covered peril and the policy provides worldwide coverage, jewelry is typically reimbursed at the lesser of the actual cash value, the cost to repair/replace, or the scheduled amount, rather than a guaranteed 'Agreed Value' payment (which is reserved for Fine Arts).", "final_decision": "REFUSAL", "reason": "The appraisal provided is 48 months old, exceeding the 36-month age limit required for items valued over $5,000.
