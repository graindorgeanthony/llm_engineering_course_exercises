# Privacy and Data Handling in Claims Policy

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This policy outlines the principles, requirements, and procedures for the secure and compliant handling of personal data, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI), collected and processed during the claims management lifecycle. The purpose is to ensure adherence to applicable data privacy regulations, including but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), as well as internal company standards. This policy aims to protect the privacy rights of claimants, prevent data breaches, and maintain public trust.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and any third parties who access, process, store, or transmit claimant data on behalf of [Company Name] in connection with claims management activities. It covers all forms of data (electronic, paper, verbal) and all stages of the claims process, from initial intake to final resolution and archiving.

**Included:**
*   Collection, storage, processing, transmission, and disposal of PII and PHI related to claims.
*   Internal and external access to claimant data.
*   Data sharing with third-party administrators, legal counsel, medical providers, and other authorized entities.
*   All claims types (e.g., auto, property, health, liability, workers' compensation).

**Excluded:**
*   Data not categorized as PII or PHI.
*   Data handling activities for general HR or marketing purposes (covered by separate policies).

## 3. Definitions

*   **Personally Identifiable Information (PII):** Any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as name, social security number, date of birth, biometric records, etc., alone or when combined with other personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information.
*   **Protected Health Information (PHI):** Individually identifiable health information transmitted or maintained by a covered entity or its business associates, in any form or medium (i.e., electronic, paper, or oral). This includes demographic information, medical histories, test results, insurance information, and other information used to identify a patient or provide health services.
*   **Claimant Data:** All PII and PHI collected from or about an individual initiating a claim.
*   **Data Controller:** [Company Name], which determines the purposes and means of processing personal data.
*   **Data Processor:** Any entity that processes personal data on behalf of [Company Name].
*   **Data Breach:** A security incident that results in the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed.
*   **Consent:** Any freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.

## 4. Principles for Data Handling

All claimant data handling activities must adhere to the following principles:

*   **Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency:** Data must be processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject.
*   **Purpose Limitation:** Data must be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes related to claim processing and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes.
*   **Data Minimization:** Only data that is adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed shall be collected.
*   **Accuracy:** Personal data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. Inaccurate data should be rectified or erased without delay.
*   **Storage Limitation:** Data should be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed, or as required by law or regulatory obligation.
*   **Integrity and Confidentiality:** Personal data must be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, using appropriate technical or organizational measures.
*   **Accountability:** [Company Name] is responsible for, and must be able to demonstrate compliance with, the above principles.

## 5. Requirements for Data Handling in Claims

### 5.1. Data Collection

*   **Consent:** Express, informed consent from the claimant is required before collecting sensitive PII/PHI, unless a legal basis or legitimate interest permits otherwise (e.g., contractual necessity, legal obligation, vital interests). The consent form (Form PRV-001) must clearly state the types of data collected, the purpose of collection, and potential recipients.
*   **Source:** Claimant data should primarily be collected directly from the claimant or their authorized representative. Information from third parties (e.g., medical providers, police reports, other insurers) must be obtained with claimant consent or a documented legal basis.
*   **Minimum Necessary:** Only data strictly necessary for processing the specific claim shall be collected. Claims adjusters and intake specialists must evaluate the relevance of data fields.

### 5.2. Data Storage and Retention

*   **Security Controls:** All electronic claimant data must be stored on secure, encrypted servers within approved data centers. Physical documents must be stored in locked cabinets or restricted-access storage facilities.
*   **Access Control:** Access to claimant data systems (e.g., CMS, eFile) is restricted to personnel requiring access for their job function, based on the principle of least privilege. Access permissions are reviewed quarterly by the IT Security Department.
*   **Retention Period:** Claimant data must be retained according to legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations. The standard retention period for closed claim files is 7 years from the date of final claim payment or denial, unless specific regulations (e.g., workers' compensation records often require longer retention) mandate otherwise. After the retention period, data must be securely disposed of.

### 5.3. Data Processing and Use

*   **Purpose-Specific Processing:** Claimant data may only be used for the purposes for which it was collected, primarily claims assessment, adjudication, payment, fraud detection, and regulatory compliance.
*   **Anonymization/Pseudonymization:** Where feasible and appropriate, data should be anonymized or pseudonymized for analytical purposes or internal reporting to reduce privacy risk.
*   **Employee Training:** All employees handling claimant data must complete annual data privacy and security training (Module SEC-002) and acknowledge understanding of this policy.

### 5.4. Data Sharing and Disclosure

*   **Third-Party Vendors:** Any third-party vendor (e.g., independent adjusters, medical reviewers, legal counsel, repair shops) processing claimant data on behalf of [Company Name] must sign a Data Processing Addendum (DPA) or Business Associate Agreement (BAA) ensuring they meet [Company Name]'s data security and privacy standards.
*   **Legal/Regulatory Obligations:** Data may be disclosed to government authorities or law enforcement agencies when legally required (e.g., subpoena, court order), but such disclosures must be reviewed and approved by the Legal Department.
*   **Claimant Authorization:** Disclosure to any other party requires explicit written authorization from the claimant (Form PRV-002: Authorization for Release of Information).
*   **Cross-Border Transfers:** Transfers of claimant data outside of its country of origin or the relevant economic zone (e.g., EU/EEA) must comply with international data transfer mechanisms (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses, Binding Corporate Rules, EU-US Data Privacy Framework). All such transfers must be approved by the Privacy Officer.

## 6. Claimant Rights

Claimants have the following rights regarding their personal data, subject to legal limitations:

*   **Right to Access:** Claimants may request access to their personal data held by [Company Name]. Requests must be submitted via email to privacy@company.com or by mail to the Privacy Officer. [Company Name] will respond within 30 days.
*   **Right to Rectification:** Claimants can request correction of inaccurate or incomplete personal data.
*   **Right to Erasure ("Right to Be Forgotten"):** Claimants can request the deletion of their personal data under certain circumstances (e.g., data no longer necessary for the claim, withdrawal of consent where no other legal basis exists). This right may be limited by legal retention requirements for claims.
*   **Right to Restriction of Processing:** Claimants may request to restrict the processing of their data under specific conditions (e.g., dispute the accuracy, unlawful processing).
*   **Right to Data Portability:** Claimants may request to receive their personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.
*   **Right to Object:** Claimants have the right to object to the processing of their personal data based on legitimate interests or for direct marketing.
*   **Right to Withdraw Consent:** Claimants have the right to withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Withdrawal of consent may impact the ability to process or conclude a claim.

## 7. Data Breach Response

In the event of a suspected or actual data breach involving claimant data:

1.  **Immediate Notification:** Any employee discovering a potential data breach must immediately notify the IT Security Department (security@company.com) and the Privacy Officer (privacy@company.com) within 1 hour of discovery.
2.  **Investigation:** The IT Security Department, in coordination with the Privacy Officer, will conduct an immediate investigation to assess the nature, scope, and impact of the breach.
3.  **Containment and Remediation:** Steps will be taken to contain the breach, mitigate harm, and restore system integrity.
4.  **Notification to Affected Parties:** If the breach is determined to pose a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, affected claimants will be notified without undue delay and, where required by law (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA), within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach. The notification will include a description of the breach, the likely consequences, and the measures taken or proposed.
5.  **Regulatory Reporting:** Relevant supervisory authorities (e.g., ICO for GDPR, HHS for HIPAA, CCPA Attorney General) will be notified as required by applicable laws.
6.  **Documentation:** All steps taken during the breach response process will be thoroughly documented.

## 8. Enforcement and Compliance

Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract, and may also expose [Company Name] and individuals to legal penalties and reputational damage. All employees are responsible for understanding and adhering to this policy. Regular audits will be conducted by the Compliance Department to ensure ongoing adherence.

## 9. Exceptions

Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and formally approved in writing by both the head of the Claims Department and the Privacy Officer. Exceptions will only be granted in extraordinary circumstances where a clear business need exists and alternative safeguards are implemented to protect claimant data.
