# Litigation Holds Process Policy

## 1. Overview

This policy outlines the procedure for implementing and managing litigation holds within [Your Company Name]. A litigation hold is a proactive measure to preserve all forms of potentially relevant information (Electronically Stored Information - ESI, paper documents, physical evidence) when litigation is reasonably anticipated or initiated against or by the company. The purpose of this policy is to ensure compliance with legal obligations to preserve information, prevent spoliation of evidence, and mitigate legal risk associated with claims, investigations, and lawsuits.

## 2. Purpose

The primary purpose of this policy is to establish a clear, consistent, and legally defensible process for identifying, implementing, and managing litigation holds. This includes defining responsibilities, outlining criteria for initiating and releasing holds, and detailing steps for ensuring the comprehensive preservation of relevant information.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, agents, and relevant third-party vendors of [Your Company Name] who may possess, create, or steward information potentially relevant to a legal matter. It covers all company data and information systems, including but not limited to:

*   Email communications (Outlook, Gmail)
*   Instant messages (Teams, Slack, Zoom Chat)
*   Documents and files stored on company servers, cloud storage (SharePoint, Google Drive), and local workstations
*   Databases and structured data systems (CRM, ERP, claims management systems)
*   Voicemail and audio recordings
*   Video recordings
*   Hard copy documents and physical files
*   Mobile device data (text messages, call logs, application data)
*   Social media content related to company business
*   Metadata associated with ESI

**Exclusions:**
This policy does not cover routine data retention schedules unless overridden by an active litigation hold instruction.

## 4. Definitions

*   **Custodian:** Any individual who possesses, controls, or has knowledge of relevant information subject to a litigation hold. This often includes employees, but can also extend to contractors or former employees.
*   **Electronically Stored Information (ESI):** Information created, manipulated, communicated, stored, and best utilized in digital form, requiring computer hardware and software for its use.
*   **Litigation Hold (or Legal Hold):** A process by which an organization notifies individuals of their obligation to preserve all forms of potentially relevant information and suspends routine document destruction or alteration policies.
*   **Reasonably Anticipated Litigation:** When an organization is aware of an event, circumstance, or communication that makes it likely that legal action will be initiated, or when it intends to initiate legal action itself. Triggers can include receipt of a demand letter, claim, subpoena, government inquiry, or an event likely to result in a lawsuit (e.g., major accident, product defect reports, significant employee dispute).
*   **Spoliation:** The intentional, reckless, or negligent withholding, altering, or destruction of evidence relevant to a legal proceeding. Spoliation can result in severe sanctions, including monetary penalties, adverse inference instructions to juries, and even dismissal of a case.

## 6. Litigation Hold Process Steps

### 6.1. Step 1: Identification of Triggering Event

A litigation hold is triggered when there is an **actual or reasonably anticipated legal obligation** to preserve information. Examples of triggering events include:

*   Receipt of a subpoena, summons, complaint, or demand letter.
*   Notice of a government investigation or regulatory inquiry.
*   Formal or informal notification of a potential claim or lawsuit (e.g., communication from an attorney, internal ethics complaint escalating to potential legal action).
*   Knowledge of an event that has a high probability of resulting in litigation (e.g., major accident, significant data breach, product recall, significant employee grievance).
*   A decision by [Your Company Name] to initiate litigation.

### 6.2. Step 2: Legal Department Assessment

Upon identification of a triggering event, the Legal Department will:

*   **Assess Reasonableness:** Determine if litigation is reasonably anticipated and if a hold is necessary.
*   **Scope Determination:** Identify the subject matter, timeframes, and potential parties involved in the anticipated litigation.
*   **Initial Custodian Identification:** Based on the subject matter, identify initial key custodians and relevant data sources (e.g., specific departments, projects, systems).

### 6.3. Step 3: Issuing the Litigation Hold Notice

Once the Legal Department determines a hold is necessary:

1.  **Draft Notice:** A formal Litigation Hold Notice will be drafted. The notice will include:
    *   Explicit instruction to preserve all relevant information.
    *   Description of the subject matter of the legal matter (as broadly as possible without disclosing privileged information).
    *   The relevant date range for information preservation.
    *   Examples of types of information to preserve (e.g., emails, documents, reports, voicemails).
    *   Specific instructions on what _not_ to do (e.g., delete, alter, destroy, or allow for routine destruction of relevant information).
    *   Instruction to identify and report any other potentially relevant custodians or data sources.
    *   A deadline for acknowledging receipt of the notice (typically 3 business days).
    *   A clear point of contact in the Legal Department for questions.
2.  **Custodian Distribution:** The notice will be distributed to all identified custodians via email, often facilitated by a dedicated legal hold software system.
3.  **IT Notification:** The IT Department will be simultaneously informed to institute technical holds (e.g., mailbox holds, backup retention adjustments) for the identified custodians and data sources.
4.  **Acknowledgement Tracking:** The Legal Department will track the acknowledgment of all custodians. Follow-up will occur for non-responsive custodians within 5 business days of initial notice.

### 6.4. Step 4: Ongoing Management of the Hold

*   **Periodic Reminders:** The Legal Department will issue periodic reminders (e.g., quarterly) to custodians with active holds to reinforce their preservation obligations.
*   **Custodian Changes:** The Legal Department must be notified immediately if:
    *   A custodian subject to a hold is leaving the company.
    *   A custodian's role or access to information changes significantly.
    *   New custodians are identified who may possess relevant information.
*   **Scope Adjustments:** The scope of the hold (e.g., subject matter, date range, custodians) may be revised as the legal matter evolves. Any changes will be communicated to affected custodians and IT.
*   **Documentation:** All communications, decisions, and actions related to the litigation hold will be meticulously documented by the Legal Department.

### 6.5. Step 5: Releasing the Litigation Hold

A litigation hold will only be released by the Legal Department when the legal matter is fully resolved, and all appeals periods have expired, or when specifically instructed by internal or external legal counsel.

1.  **Legal Determination:** The Legal Department will formally determine that the obligation to preserve information no longer exists.
2.  **Issuing Release Notice:** A formal Litigation Hold Release Notice will be issued to all affected custodians and the IT Department.
3.  **IT Actions:** Upon receipt of the release notice, IT will remove technical holds and revert data retention policies to their standard settings for the previously held data.
4.  **Custodian Acknowledgement (Optional):** Custodians may be asked to acknowledge receipt of the release notice.

## 7. Evidence/Documentation

The Legal Department will maintain a central repository for all litigation hold documentation, including:

*   Records of triggering events (e.g., claim filing, subpoena date).
*   Copies of all Litigation Hold Notices issued.
*   Records of custodian acknowledgments and follow-ups.
*   Lists of identified custodians and data sources.
*   Records of communications with IT regarding technical holds.
*   Documentation of any scope changes or amendments.
*   Copies of all Litigation Hold Release Notices issued.
*   Relevant correspondence with internal and external counsel regarding the hold.

## 8. Training and Compliance

*   All employees, particularly managers and those in roles likely to be custodians (e.g., claims handlers, legal support, HR, IT), will receive training on their obligations under this policy.
*   Failure to adhere to this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, and may expose the company to significant legal sanctions.

## 9. Exceptions

Any exceptions to this policy must be reviewed and approved in writing by the General Counsel or their designated representative prior to implementation. Exceptions will be granted only in extraordinary circumstances where strict adherence would cause undue hardship or conflict with other overriding legal obligations, and only when such exceptions do not compromise the company's legal preservation obligations.
