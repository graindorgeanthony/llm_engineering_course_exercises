# Subrogation Policy Guidelines

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This policy establishes the guidelines and procedures for the pursuit of subrogation by [Your Company Name] (hereinafter referred to as "the Company"). Subrogation is the legal right the Company holds to pursue a third party that caused a loss to an insured, for which the Company has paid a claim. The purpose of this policy is to ensure consistent, efficient, and effective recovery of claim payments from responsible third parties, thereby minimizing financial losses to the Company and its policyholders through diligent claim management and adherence to legal principles.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all claims personnel, legal teams, and departments involved in the claims handling process across all lines of business within [Your Company Name] where an identifiable third party may be liable for a covered loss.

**Included:**
*   Property & Casualty claims (e.g., auto, general liability, property damage).
*   Workers' Compensation claims where a liable third party exists.
*   Claims where the Company has made a payment to an insured and a third party's negligence or action caused the loss.

**Excluded:**
*   Claims where subrogation rights have been expressly waived by policy language or specific, documented Company approval.
*   Claims where the cost of pursuing subrogation is expected to exceed the potential recovery, as determined by the Subrogation Director or designated authority.
*   Claims under policies specifically designated as "no subrogation" products.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Subrogation:** The right for an insurer to pursue a third party that caused an insurance loss to the insured. This is done to recover the amount of the claim paid to the insured.
*   **Insured:** The party covered by an insurance policy issued by the Company.
*   **Third Party:** An individual, entity, or organization, not party to the insurance contract, who is legally responsible for causing the loss or damage to the insured property or person.
*   **Claim Payment:** The amount disbursed by the Company to an insured or on behalf of an insured for a covered loss.
*   **Recovery:** Funds recouped by the Company through subrogation efforts from a responsible third party.
*   **Statute of Limitations (SOL):** The maximum period of time after an event within which legal proceedings may be initiated.

## 4. Subrogation Identification and Referral

All claims adjusters are responsible for the initial identification of potential subrogation opportunities during the claims investigation process.

### 4.1. Identification Criteria

A claim is considered to have subrogation potential if all of the following conditions are met:
*   A claim payment has been made or is anticipated to be made by the Company.
*   There is evidence or reasonable belief that a third party's action or negligence directly caused the loss.
*   The third party's identity can be reasonably determined.
*   The third party appears to have assets or insurance coverage to cover the loss.
*   The estimated recoverable amount exceeds the minimum threshold for pursuit (see Section 4.2).

### 4.2. Minimum Subrogation Thresholds

*   **Auto Physical Damage:** Potential recovery of $1,000 or more.
*   **Property Damage:** Potential recovery of $2,500 or more.
*   **Workers' Compensation:** Any potential recovery if a liable third party is identified, regardless of monetary value, due to implications for experience modification rates.
*   **Other Lines (e.g., General Liability):** Potential recovery of $5,000 or more, or as directed by the Subrogation Director.

### 4.3. Referral Process

Claims identified with subrogation potential must be referred to the dedicated Subrogation Unit within **30 days** of initial claim payment or identification of third-party liability, whichever occurs first.

#### 4.3.1. Required Documentation for Referral
The following documents must be attached to the claim file and clearly indexed for subrogation review:
*   Complete claim file notes detailing the incident.
*   Loss Report/First Notice of Loss (FNOL).
*   Police Report or Fire Department Report (if applicable).
*   Photographs of damage.
*   Appraisal reports or repair estimates/invoices.
*   Proof of claim payment (e.g., cancelled checks, payment ledger).
*   Subrogation Demand Letter template (initial draft recommended).
*   Any available third-party contact information (name, address, vehicle information, insurance details).
*   Witness statements (if available).
*   Relevant policy declarations page illustrating coverage.

## 5. Subrogation Pursuit Process

Once a claim is referred to the Subrogation Unit, the following process will be generally followed:

### 5.1. File Review and Research

The Subrogation Specialist will:
*   Review all submitted documentation for completeness and viability.
*   Conduct further investigation to identify legal liability, potential responsible parties, and available insurance coverage.
*   Assess applicable Statutes of Limitation (SOL) and critical deadlines.
*   Confirm the right to subrogate, including any waivers or endorsements.

### 5.2. Demand and Negotiation

*   A formal demand letter will be issued to the at-fault third party and/or their insurer, outlining the incident, the basis of their liability, and the amount sought.
*   Negotiations will be initiated to secure maximum recovery. All offers and counter-offers must be documented in the claim file.
*   Settlement authority limits for Subrogation Specialists are outlined in the Company's Claims Authority Matrix.

### 5.3. Legal Action

If negotiations fail to achieve a satisfactory resolution within **90 days** of the initial demand, or if SOL dictates, the claim may be escalated for legal action.
*   Legal action may include arbitration, litigation, or engagement of external legal counsel.
*   All legal referrals must be approved by the Subrogation Director and/or Legal Department.
*   Detailed cost-benefit analysis will be conducted before initiating litigation (estimated legal costs vs. potential recovery).

### 5.4. Recovery and Closure

*   Upon successful recovery, funds will be posted to the relevant claim file and financial accounts.
*   The claim file will be closed following adherence to all applicable internal procedures and legal requirements.
*   If recovery is deemed impossible after exhaustive efforts, the claim will be closed with appropriate documentation of non-recovery reasons.

## 6. Decision Logic for Subrogation Pursuit

|                                   | **Decline/Close**                                                     | Estimated recovery < Minimum Subrogation Threshold, *and* no strategic value.  |
| **Liability of Third Party**      | **Pursue**                                                            | Clear evidence of third-party negligence or responsibility (e.g., police report, witness statements, accident reconstruction). |
|                                   | **Decline**                                                           | Insufficient evidence of third-party liability, or significant comparative negligence of insured. |
| **Financial Viability**           | **Pursue**                                                            | Third party has identifiable assets or valid insurance coverage.               |
|                                   | **Decline**                                                           | Third party is uninsured, insolvent, or assets are uncollectible.              |
| **Cost of Pursuit**               | **Pursue**                                                            | Anticipated cost of subrogation pursuit (e.g., legal fees, investigation) < 50% of potential recovery. |
|                                   | **Decline**                                                           | Anticipated cost of subrogation pursuit > 50% of potential recovery, or exceeds expected recovery. |
| **Statute of Limitations (SOL)**  | **Prioritize/Accelerate**                                             | SOL expiration is within 6 months.                                             |
|                                   | **Decline**                                                           | SOL has expired.                                                               |

## 7. Exceptions

*   Waiving subrogation for specific policyholders under exceptional circumstances, requiring Senior Vice President of Claims approval.

## 8. Evidence and Documentation

Maintaining a comprehensive and accurate record of all subrogation activities is paramount. All communications, investigations, demands, negotiations, and recovery efforts must be meticulously documented within the Company's claims management system (CMS) and/or hard copy claim file. This includes:
*   All correspondence with the third party, their insurer, and legal counsel.
*   Internal memoranda and decision-making rationale.
