# Ex Gratia Payments Policy

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This policy outlines the principles, conditions, and procedures governing the authorization and processing of ex gratia payments made by [Company Name]. Ex gratia payments are discretionary payments made in good faith to customers or other stakeholders, typically in circumstances where there is no legal obligation or contractual liability to do so. The primary purpose of this policy is to provide a framework for these payments to enhance customer satisfaction, maintain goodwill, resolve disputes, or address unique hardship situations, while ensuring financial prudence and consistency in decision-making.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all employees, agents, and contractors of [Company Name] involved in the assessment, recommendation, or approval of claims, and specifically to situations where a payment is considered outside of standard policy coverage, contractual terms, or legal requirements. It covers payments made to policyholders, claimants, or third parties that do not fall under routine claim settlements.

### 2.1. Inclusions

*   Payments made to resolve customer dissatisfaction where a claim is technically declined or partially paid.
*   Payments made in situations of severe customer hardship not covered by standard policies.
*   Payments made to maintain critical business relationships or reputation.
*   Payments made as a gesture of goodwill or ethical consideration.

### 2.2. Exclusions

*   Payments made as part of a standard claim settlement process based on policy terms and conditions.
*   Payments resulting from legal judgments or court orders.
*   Contractual obligations, including compensation for breach of contract.
*   Payments covered by other specific company policies (e.g., employee bonuses, routine refunds).

## 3. Definitions

*   **Ex Gratia Payment:** A payment made as a gesture of goodwill, compassion, or to resolve a dispute, without admission of legal liability or contractual obligation.
*   **Claimant/Customer:** Any individual or entity receiving an ex gratia payment.
*   **Approving Authority:** The manager or executive with delegated authority to authorize ex gratia payments based on specified thresholds.
*   **Hardship:** Circumstances resulting in significant financial or personal difficulty for the claimant.
*   **Goodwill:** The intangible asset of a business that is generated from customer satisfaction and positive public perception.

## 4. Eligibility and Criteria for Consideration

Ex gratia payments are not an entitlement. Consideration for an ex gratia payment requires the claim to meet at least one of the following criteria:

### 4.1. Customer Dissatisfaction/Resolution Potential

*   The customer has expressed significant dissatisfaction with [Company Name]'s service or a claims outcome, even if the service or outcome was technically correct.
*   The payment is likely to resolve a persistent complaint, prevent further escalation, or mitigate negative publicity.
*   The cost of processing and managing the ongoing complaint outweighs the proposed ex gratia payment.

### 4.2. Hardship or Special Circumstances

*   The claimant can demonstrate severe financial or personal hardship directly or indirectly related to an event or interaction with [Company Name], where standard policy provisions offer no or insufficient relief.
*   There are unique, unforeseen circumstances not adequately addressed by existing policies, but where a moral or ethical obligation is perceived.

### 4.3. Reputation and Relationship Management

*   The payment is necessary to preserve a critical business relationship (e.g., partner, high-value client).
*   Failure to make a payment could significantly damage [Company Name]'s reputation or public image.
*   The payment promotes long-term customer loyalty or market standing.

### 4.4. Error or Oversight (Non-Binding)

*   While not legally liable, an internal review identifies a procedural error, miscommunication, or oversight by [Company Name] that contributed to the customer's negative experience or loss. This does not imply admission of liability.

## 5. Decision Logic and Approval Process

All requests for ex gratia payments must follow a documented approval chain based on the proposed payment amount.

### 5.1. Initial Assessment (Claims Agent/Case Manager)

1.  Identify a potential situation for an ex gratia payment based on the criteria in Section 4.
2.  Gather all relevant claim documents, correspondence, internal notes, and customer feedback.
3.  Prepare an "Ex Gratia Payment Recommendation Form" (Form EG-001) detailing:
    *   Claimant Name and Policy/Claim Number
    *   Date of Incident/Complaint
    *   Brief summary of the original claim/issue
    *   Reasons why the claim does not meet standard policy criteria (if applicable)
    *   Specific criteria from Section 4 that are met for consideration
    *   Recommended ex gratia amount and justification
    *   Expected positive outcome of the payment (e.g., complaint resolution, customer retention)
    *   Any precedent implications.

### 5.2. Manager Review and Recommendation (Team Lead/Supervisor)

1.  Review the "Ex Gratia Payment Recommendation Form" and supporting documentation.
2.  Assess adherence to policy criteria and completeness of justification.
3.  Add comments and recommendation: approve, reject, or request further information.
4.  If recommended for approval, forward to the appropriate Approving Authority based on the payment amount.

### 5.3. Approval Tiers and Thresholds

| Payment Amount             | Approving Authority                | Required Documentation                               |
| :------------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| Up to \$1,000              | Senior Claims Adjuster/Team Lead   | EG-001, Claim File Summary                           |
| \$1,001 - \$5,000          | Department Manager                 | EG-001, Claim File, Customer Correspondence          |
| \$5,001 - \$10,000         | Regional Operations Director       | EG-001, Full Claim File, Management Justification    |
| Above \$10,000             | Executive Committee/CEO            | EG-001, Full Claim File, Legal Counsel Review (if > \$25,000) |
| *Maximum Ex Gratia Payment* | \$50,000 (Individual Case Limit)  |                                                      |

*Any payment exceeding the maximum individual case limit of \$50,000 requires explicit Board of Directors approval.*

### 5.4. Final Decision and Notification

1.  The Approving Authority reviews the complete submission and makes a final decision.
2.  If approved, the Approving Authority signs the EG-001 form.
3.  The Claims Agent/Case Manager is notified of the decision.
4.  The Claims Agent/Case Manager communicates the decision to the claimant in writing, clearly stating that the payment is ex gratia, made without admission of liability, and does not create a precedent. A standard ex gratia payment letter template must be used (Template EG-LTR-001).

## 6. Evidence and Documentation Requirements

*   Completed "Ex Gratia Payment Recommendation Form" (EG-001).
*   All relevant claim file documents, policy terms, and correspondence.
*   Internal communications and notes related to the incident and complaint.
*   Evidence of hardship (if applicable, e.g., medical reports, financial statements – handled with strict privacy protocols).
*   Signed approval from the relevant authority level.
*   Copy of the ex gratia payment notification letter (EG-LTR-001) sent to the claimant.
*   Record of payment transaction.

All documentation must be stored in the electronic claim management system for a minimum of 7 years.

## 7. Exceptions

Exceptions to this policy require explicit approval from the Executive Committee and must be fully documented with compelling justification. Such exceptions are rare and typically reserved for highly sensitive or precedent-setting situations.

## 8. Examples

**Example 1: Customer Goodwill Payment**
*   **Scenario:** A long-standing customer (15 years with [Company Name]) submitted a claim for water damage. The claim was declined because the damage was caused by a known pre-existing structural defect explicitly excluded in their policy. The customer expressed extreme dissatisfaction and threatened to switch providers.
*   **Assessment:** While no contractual liability, the customer's loyalty and potential loss of future business are significant. The cost of losing the customer (estimated lifetime value) outweighs a small goodwill gesture.
*   **Decision:** An ex gratia payment of \$750 was approved by the Senior Claims Adjuster to cover partially related repair costs, accompanied by a letter emphasizing it's a goodwill gesture.
*   **Rationale:** Meets "Customer Dissatisfaction/Resolution Potential" and "Reputation and Relationship Management" criteria.

**Example 2: Hardship Consideration**
*   **Scenario:** A catastrophic event destroyed a customer's uninsured shed which contained essential medical equipment. The main policy covered the house, but the shed was specifically excluded due to its age and condition. The customer, on a fixed income, cannot afford to replace the equipment.
*   **Assessment:** No policy coverage for the shed. However, the loss of essential medical equipment creates severe hardship for the claimant.
*   **Decision:** An ex gratia payment of \$3,500 was approved by the Department Manager to assist with replacing the medical equipment.
*   **Rationale:** Meets "Hardship or Special Circumstances" criteria.

**Example 3: No Ex Gratia Payment**
*   **Scenario:** A new customer (6 months with [Company Name]) submits a claim for property damage caused by intentional vandalism by a third-party. Their policy explicitly excludes damage caused by vandalism where a police report is not filed within 24 hours. The customer filed the report 3 days later, and the claim was declined. They demand an ex gratia payment.
*   **Assessment:** The policy exclusion is clear. No evidence of long-term loyalty or unique hardship. Granting an ex gratia payment in this case would create an undesirable precedent.
*   **Decision:** Ex gratia payment declined by the Team Lead. Customer was informed of the policy terms and the reason for the decision.
*   **Rationale:** Does not meet any primary criteria for ex gratia consideration.
