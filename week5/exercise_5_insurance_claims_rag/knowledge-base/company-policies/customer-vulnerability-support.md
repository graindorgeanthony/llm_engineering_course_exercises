# Customer Vulnerability Support Policy (Claims)

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This policy outlines the principles, processes, and responsibilities for identifying, assessing, and providing appropriate support to vulnerable customers throughout the claims management process. Our commitment is to ensure fair treatment, maintain dignity, and prevent detriment to customers who may be in vulnerable circumstances. This policy applies to all claims personnel, third-party administrators, and any agents interacting with customers regarding a claim.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all claims handled by [Your Company Name], across all product lines (e.g., auto, home, life, health, travel). It covers the entire claims lifecycle, from first notification of loss (FNOL) to claim resolution and post-settlement communication.
This policy *does not* specifically cover general customer service interactions outside of the claims process, though its principles align with broader company customer care standards.

### 2.1 Inclusions
*   Identification of potential vulnerability indicators.
*   Assessment and recording of vulnerability.
*   Provision of appropriate adjustments and support.
*   Training requirements for claims staff.
*   Data protection and confidentiality considerations.

### 2.2 Exclusions
*   Detailed operational procedures for specific claim types (these are covered in separate process documents).
*   General fraud detection protocols (these are handled under the Anti-Fraud Policy).

## 3. Definitions

*   **Vulnerable Customer:** A customer who, due to their personal circumstances, is especially susceptible to detriment, particularly when a firm is not acting with appropriate levels of care. This may include, but is not limited to, factors such as health conditions, life events, financial difficulties, capability, or resilience.
*   **Vulnerability Indicator:** Any observable behavior, statement, or circumstance that suggests a customer may be vulnerable.
*   **Reasonable Adjustment:** A modification to standard processes or services to accommodate a customer's vulnerability and ensure they receive fair treatment and can fully participate in the claims process.
*   **Detriment:** Any harm, disadvantage, or loss experienced by a customer.
*   **First Notice of Loss (FNOL):** The initial reporting of a claim event by the customer or on their behalf.
*   **Claims Handler:** Any employee or authorized agent responsible for managing a customer's claim.

## 4. Principles for Vulnerability Support

Our approach to supporting vulnerable customers is founded on the following principles:

1.  **Empathy and Respect:** All interactions will be conducted with empathy, respect, and non-judgment.
2.  **Proactive Identification:** We will strive to proactively identify vulnerability indicators at all stages of the claims process.
3.  **Tailored Support:** Support will be individualized and proportionate to the customer's specific needs and circumstances.
4.  **Confidentiality:** All information regarding a customer's vulnerability will be handled with the strictest confidentiality and in accordance with data protection regulations.
5.  **Empowerment:** We will empower customers to make informed decisions and ensure they understand the claims process.
6.  **Continuous Improvement:** We will regularly review and improve our policies and procedures based on feedback and best practices.

## 5. Identification of Vulnerability

Claims handlers are trained to recognize various forms of vulnerability and their indicators. Identification can occur at any stage but is particularly crucial during FNOL.

### 5.1 Categories of Vulnerability
Key categories of vulnerability include, but are not limited to:

*   **Health:** Physical disability, long-term illness, mental health conditions, cognitive impairment (e.g., dementia, learning disabilities), addiction.
*   **Life Events:** Bereavement, recent divorce/separation, job loss, domestic abuse, homelessness, recent traumatic event (e.g., accident, severe injury).
*   **Resilience:** Low financial resilience (e.g., debt, unstable income), low emotional resilience (e.g., easily distressed, anxious).
*   **Capability:** Low literacy, limited English proficiency, lack of digital skills, communication difficulties (speech, hearing), lack of understanding of complex financial products or processes.

### 5.2 Indicators of Vulnerability (Examples)
*   Repeatedly asking for clarification or expressing confusion.
*   Appearing distressed, anxious, or overwhelmed.
*   Mentioning recent traumatic events (e.g., "I just lost my husband," "I was in the hospital for weeks").
*   Difficulty articulating their situation clearly.
*   Disclosing a long-term illness, disability, or mental health condition.
*   Stating they are acting on behalf of someone else who is unwell or unable to communicate.
*   Expressing financial strain or desperation.
*   Communication barriers (e.g., strong accent, speech impediment, requiring interpreter).
*   Making irrational or impulsive decisions.

## 6. Assessment and Recording

Once a potential vulnerability indicator is identified, the claims handler must initiate an assessment.

### 6.1 Assessment Process
1.  **Listen and Observe:** Pay close attention to verbal cues, tone, pace, and any non-verbal communication (if applicable during video calls).
2.  **Ask Open Questions:** Gently inquire about the customer's circumstances to understand their needs without being intrusive or judgmental (e.g., "It sounds like you're going through a lot right now. Is there anything we can do to make this process easier for you?").
3.  **Confirm Understanding:** Verify the customer understands the information provided and the next steps.
4.  **Determine Impact:** Assess how the identified vulnerability might impact the customer's ability to communicate, make decisions, understand information, or cope with the claims process.

### 6.2 Recording Vulnerability
*   All identified vulnerabilities and the reasonable adjustments provided MUST be accurately recorded in the claim file notes system ([Claims Management System Name]) within *24 business hours* of identification.
*   The recording must be factual, objective, and specific (e.g., "Customer advised they have severe hearing impairment – requires all communication via email or large print documents").
*   Sensitive data will be handled in accordance with the Data Privacy Policy and relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). Access to such information is restricted to personnel directly involved in managing the claim.
*   **No speculative or diagnostic language is to be used.** Claims handlers are not medical professionals.

## 7. Providing Appropriate Support and Reasonable Adjustments

Based on the assessment, claims handlers will implement appropriate reasonable adjustments.

### 7.1 Common Reasonable Adjustments
*   **Communication:**
    *   Offer alternative communication channels (e.g., email, postal mail, webchat, video call) if phone calls are difficult.
    *   Use simpler language, avoid jargon, and explain complex terms.
    *   Provide information in alternative formats (e.g., large print, audio, simplified summaries).
    *   Offer to speak to a nominated third party (with explicit customer consent, recorded in the claim file).
    *   Allow extended time for explanations and decision-making.
    *   Arrange for an interpreter (language or sign language) if needed.
*   **Process Adjustments:**
    *   Assign a single point of contact (dedicated claims handler) where appropriate.
    *   Extend deadlines for document submission or responses.
    *   Waive certain documentation requirements if obtaining them would cause undue stress (with management approval and alternative verification methods where possible).
    *   Prioritize urgent claims (e.g., related to property damage making home uninhabitable after trauma).
    *   Offer more frequent communication or check-ins.
    *   Refer to specialist support organizations (e.g., bereavement counseling, debt advice – with customer consent).
*   **Tone and Approach:**
    *   Maintain patience and allow the customer time to speak.
    *   Reassure the customer and confirm active listening.
    *   Repeat information in different ways if necessary.
    *   End calls/interactions by summarizing next steps and confirming understanding.

### 7.2 Escalation
If a claims handler feels unable to adequately support a vulnerable customer, or if the customer's needs are particularly complex or severe, immediate escalation to a Team Leader or Vulnerability Specialist is required. This should occur within *1 business hour* of recognizing the limitation. The escalated case will be reviewed, and an appropriate course of action determined, potentially involving a senior claims manager or specialist team.

## 8. Training and Awareness

All claims handlers and customer-facing staff undergo mandatory training on vulnerability awareness, identification, and support.

*   **Initial Training:** Within 30 days of joining the claims department.
*   **Refresher Training:** Annually, or as required by regulatory updates or internal policy changes.
*   Training includes practical case studies, role-playing, and guidance on how to manage sensitive conversations.

## 9. Confidentiality and Data Protection

Information about a customer's vulnerability is sensitive personal data.

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Access to information about a customer's vulnerability is strictly limited to staff who require it to provide appropriate support for the claim.
*   **Secure Storage:** All vulnerability-related notes and documentation will be stored securely within the [Claims Management System Name] with restricted access controls.
*   **Consent:** Where information needs to be shared with third parties (e.g., a nominated representative, an external support organization), explicit consent from the customer MUST be obtained and recorded.
*   **Retention:** Vulnerability data will be retained only for as long as necessary to manage the claim and meet regulatory obligations, in line with the company's Data Retention Policy.

## 10. Review and Monitoring

This policy will be reviewed annually, or more frequently if there are significant changes in legislation, regulatory guidance, or internal business operations.

*   **Monitoring Activities:**
    *   Regular audits of claims files to ensure adherence to this policy.
    *   Analysis of customer feedback and complaints related to vulnerability support.
    *   Review of training effectiveness.
    *   Tracking of vulnerability indicators identified and reasonable adjustments implemented.
*   **Reporting:** Key metrics and audit findings will be reported quarterly to the Claims Leadership Team and the Compliance Committee to ensure continuous improvement in our approach to customer vulnerability.
