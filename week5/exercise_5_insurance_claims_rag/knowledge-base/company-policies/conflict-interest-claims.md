# Conflict of Interest Policy for Claims Staff

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This policy outlines the rules and procedures designed to prevent, identify, and manage conflicts of interest among claims adjusters, claims managers, and all other personnel involved in the processing, evaluation, and approval of insurance claims. The purpose of this policy is to ensure impartiality, fairness, and transparency in all claims-related decisions, protect the integrity of the claims process, and maintain public trust in our organization. Adherence to this policy is mandatory for all claims staff.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, temporary staff, and any third-party personnel who are involved in or have access to information regarding the intake, investigation, evaluation, negotiation, settlement, or payment of any insurance claim handled by the company. This includes, but is not limited to, claims adjusters, claims supervisors, claims managers, administrative support staff within the claims department, and legal counsel assigned to claims cases.

This policy specifically covers:
*   Financial interests in claims or involved parties.
*   Family or close personal relationships with claimants, witnesses, or vendors.
*   Outside employment or business activities impacting claims duties.
*   Acceptance of gifts or favors.

This policy does not cover minor personal affiliations unrelated to financial gain or direct influence over a claim (e.g., attending the same community event as a claimant without prior knowledge of their claim).

## 3. Definitions

*   **Conflict of Interest:** A situation in which a claims staff member's personal interests, financial or otherwise, or those of a close relation, could potentially influence or appear to influence their objective judgment or actions in performing their official claims duties.
*   **Claims Staff:** Any employee, contractor, or other personnel involved in the processing, evaluation, or approval of insurance claims.
*   **Claimant:** An individual or entity who has submitted an insurance claim.
*   **Vendor:** Any person or entity providing goods or services in connection with an insurance claim (e.g., repair shops, medical providers, restoration services, legal firms).
*   **Close Relation:** Spouse, domestic partner, child, stepchild, parent, stepparent, sibling, in-law, any other person residing in the same household, or any other individual with whom the claims staff member has a close personal or financial relationship that could reasonably be perceived to influence their judgment.
*   **Material Interest:** A financial interest that is significant enough to influence, or give the appearance of influencing, a claims decision. This includes direct ownership, significant stock holdings, or substantial debt.

## 4. Prohibited Conflicts of Interest

Claims staff are strictly prohibited from:

*   Handling, investigating, evaluating, or making decisions on any claim where they, a close relation, or a business/organization with which they have a material interest, is the claimant, a beneficiary, a witness, or an involved third party.
*   Handling, investigating, evaluating, or making decisions on any claim where they, a close relation, or a business/organization with which they have a material interest, is a vendor providing services or goods in relation to the claim.
*   Directing claimants or policyholders to specific vendors (e.g., repair shops, legal counsel, medical professionals) where the claims staff member or a close relation has a financial interest or receives any form of compensation, referral fee, or benefit.
*   Accepting gifts, favors, entertainment, payments, loans, or services of more than nominal value (e.g., exceeding $50 in value per occurrence or cumulatively $150 per vendor per year) from any claimant, policyholder, witness, or vendor involved in a claim, or from any entity seeking to influence the claims process.
*   Using confidential claims information gained through employment for personal gain or to benefit a close relation or third party.
*   Engaging in outside employment or business activities that directly conflict with, or could reasonably be perceived to conflict with, their duties and responsibilities related to claims processing, including working for a competitor or any entity that frequently provides services to claimants.

## 5. Disclosure Requirements and Procedures

### 5.1 Initial Disclosure

All new claims staff are required to review this policy and complete a Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form (Form COI-001) upon hiring, declaring any potential conflicts of interest. This form must be submitted to the Claims Ethics Officer within five (5) business days of their start date.

### 5.2 Ongoing Disclosure

Claims staff must proactively disclose any potential or actual conflict of interest as soon as they become aware of it. Such disclosure must be made in writing via email to their immediate supervisor and the Claims Ethics Officer within twenty-four (24) hours of discovery.

### 5.3 Disclosure Form (Form COI-001) Contents

The disclosure form requires the following information:
*   Name and position of claims staff.
*   Nature of the relationship (e.g., family member, business associate, personal friend).
*   Name of the individual or entity involved in the claim (claimant, vendor, witness).
*   Claim number, if applicable.
*   Description of the potential conflict (e.g., "My cousin, John Doe, is the claimant for claim #PL-2023-5555.").
*   Date of disclosure.
*   Signature of disclosing staff member.

## 6. Management of Disclosed Conflicts

Upon receiving a disclosure of a potential conflict of interest, the following steps will be taken:

### 6.1 Review and Assessment

The immediate supervisor and the Claims Ethics Officer will review the disclosure within two (2) business days to assess the nature and severity of the potential conflict.

### 6.2 Decision Logic and Actions

Based on the assessment, one or more of the following actions will be taken:

*   **Recusal:** The claims staff member will be immediately recused from all involvement in the specific claim(s) or vendor relationship where the conflict exists. This is the primary and most common action.
    *   **Evidence:** The claim file will be documented with a "Conflict of Interest Recusal" note, including the date, reason, and the name of the assigned replacement adjuster.
*   **Reassignment:** The claim, portion of the claim, or vendor relationship will be reassigned to another qualified and impartial claims staff member.
*   **Monitoring:** In minor cases where a direct conflict of interest is not present but a perceived conflict could arise (e.g., an acquaintance is a claimant), the staff member may continue to handle the claim under close supervision by their manager, with regular checks for impartiality. This is rare and requires explicit approval from the Claims Ethics Officer.
*   **Divestment/Termination:** In severe cases, where the conflict cannot be mitigated through recusal or reassignment, the claims staff member may be required to divest themselves of the conflicting interest or, as a last resort, face disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

### 6.3 Documentation

All actions taken to manage a conflict of interest, including the original disclosure, assessment, and resolution, will be documented and maintained in a confidential file by the Claims Ethics Officer. A brief, non-sensitive note will be added to the relevant claim file indicating a conflict of interest recusal and reassignment, without detailing personal information.

## 7. Exceptions

*   This policy generally does not apply to situations where a claims staff member is a policyholder and submits a legitimate claim under their own policy, provided the claim is handled by other impartial claims staff members in accordance with standard procedures. The staff member must recuse themselves from any involvement in their own claim's adjustment.
*   Minor corporate-sponsored events or gifts of nominal value (e.g., company-branded merchandise, holiday cards) from vendors that are distributed generally and not intended to influence individual claims staff members are exempt from the gift acceptance limits, provided they are reported to the Claims Ethics Officer if cumulative value from a single vendor exceeds $150 annually.

## 8. Training and Awareness

All claims staff will receive mandatory annual training on this Conflict of Interest Policy, covering its principles, disclosure requirements, and the implications of non-compliance. New hires will complete this training as part of their onboarding process.

## 9. Non-Compliance and Disciplinary Action

Failure to comply with this Conflict of Interest Policy, including failure to disclose a potential or actual conflict, making false or misleading disclosures, or attempting to circumvent the policy, will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment, and may also lead to legal action where appropriate. Violations will be investigated by Human Resources and the Claims Ethics Officer.

## 10. Reporting Concerns

Any claims staff member who suspects or observes a potential or actual conflict of interest involving a colleague or supervisor is encouraged to report it immediately and confidentially to their supervisor, the Claims Ethics Officer, or the Human Resources Department. Retaliation against any employee who reports a concern in good faith is strictly prohibited. Reports can be made via the anonymous ethics hotline at 1-800-ETHICS-CO (ext. 4567).
