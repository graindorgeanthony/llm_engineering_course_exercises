# Ethical Conduct in Claims Policy

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This policy establishes the ethical standards and professional conduct required of all personnel involved in the claims process, including adjusters, examiners, administrative staff, and management (collectively referred to as "Claims Personnel"). The purpose of this policy is to ensure that all claims are handled with the highest degree of integrity, fairness, transparency, and in full compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and company guidelines. Upholding these standards protects the company's reputation, builds trust with policyholders, and ensures equitable outcomes.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors engaged in any aspect of claims handling for [Insurance Company Name] or its subsidiaries, worldwide. It covers all lines of business, including but not limited to auto, property, liability, and workers' compensation claims. This policy is supplementary to, and does not supersede, the Company's general Code of Conduct or any specific regulatory compliance requirements.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Claims Personnel:** Any individual involved in the processing, investigation, evaluation, negotiation, or adjudication of insurance claims.

## 5. Requirements and Guidelines

### 5.1. Handling of Claims
*   **Thorough Investigation:** All claims must be investigated thoroughly and objectively, gathering all necessary information to make an informed decision.
*   **Timely Processing:** Claims must be processed promptly and efficiently, adhering to all statutory and internal deadlines for acknowledgements, investigations, and payments.
*   **Accurate Documentation:** All claim files must contain precise, complete, and contemporaneous documentation of all actions taken, communications, evidence reviewed, and decisions made.
*   **Fair Settlements:** Claims must be settled fairly, paying valid claims in accordance with policy provisions and applicable law, and resisting invalid or fraudulent claims.

    *   Receiving gifts or favors that could influence or appear to influence decisions (see Section 5.3).
*   **Recusal:** In cases of disclosed conflicts, the Claims Personnel must recuse themselves from any involvement in the affected claim and the claim will be reassigned.

### 5.3. Gifts, Gratuities, and Entertainment
*   Claims Personnel are prohibited from soliciting or accepting gifts, gratuities, lavish entertainment, or any other items of value from claimants, policyholders, vendors, or any party involved in a claim, if such items could reasonably be perceived to influence or obligate the Claims Personnel in the performance of their duties.
*   Modest gifts of nominal value (e.g., promotional items under $50 USD) and infrequent, reasonable business meals may be accepted if they are part of normal business practice and do not create an appearance of impropriety. All such instances must be reported to the Claims Manager.
