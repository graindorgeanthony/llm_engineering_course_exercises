# Salvage Handling Policy

## Overview/Purpose

This policy outlines the procedures and guidelines for the identification, valuation, recovery, and disposal of salvaged property resulting from insurance claims. The primary objective is to minimize financial loss by maximizing the recovery value from damaged property while ensuring compliance with legal and ethical standards, and efficient claim resolution. This policy aims to provide a clear framework for claims adjusters, salvage specialists, and third-party vendors involved in the salvage process.

## Scope

This policy applies to all claims involving property damage that may result in recoverable salvage value, across all lines of business including, but not limited to, automotive, property (residential and commercial), and marine.

### Inclusions:
*   Damaged vehicles declared total losses.
*   Damaged household goods and personal property with residual value.
*   Commercial equipment, machinery, and inventory with recoverable components.
*   Marine vessels and cargo with salvage potential.

### Exclusions:
*   Property with an estimated salvage value below \$100, which is typically deemed uneconomical to process.
*   Perishable goods where immediate disposal is required and no recoverable value is anticipated.
*   Hazardous materials requiring specialized disposal protocols not covered under standard salvage operations. Refer to the "Hazardous Waste Management Policy" for such instances.

## Definitions

*   **Salvage:** Damaged property that retains some economic value after an insured event and is typically acquired by the insurer as part of the claim settlement process (e.g., in total loss scenarios where the insurer pays the insured value).
*   **Salvage Value:** The estimated market value of damaged property after a loss.
*   **Total Loss:** A situation where the cost to repair damaged property exceeds a predefined percentage of its actual cash value (ACV) or replacement cost, making repair economically unfeasible.
*   **Actual Cash Value (ACV):** The cost to replace an item minus depreciation.
*   **Replacement Cost (RC):** The cost to replace an item with a similar new item without deduction for depreciation.
*   **Salvage Bid:** An offer from a third-party buyer for salvaged property.
*   **Subrogation:** The right for an insurer to pursue a third party that caused an insurance loss to the insured. Salvage recovery is often linked to subrogation efforts.

## Main Content: Salvage Identification and Valuation

### 1. Identification of Salvage Potential

Claims adjusters are responsible for identifying potential salvage at the initial stages of a claim.
*   **Total Loss Declaration:** For vehicles, a total loss is declared when repair costs exceed 75% of the Actual Cash Value (ACV). For other property, this threshold is 80%.
*   **Irreparable Damage:** Property assessed as irreparable due to the nature of the damage (e.g., severe structural damage, extensive fire damage).
*   **Insured's Intent:** If the insured wishes to relinquish ownership of the damaged property after claim settlement.

### 2. Initial Salvage Valuation

Upon declaration of a potential total loss or significant damage, the claims adjuster must initiate an initial salvage valuation.
*   **Automotive:** Use approved third-party valuation services (e.g., CCC One, Audatex) to determine pre-loss ACV and estimated salvage return.
*   **Property/Contents:**
    *   Consult with internal salvage specialists for high-value items (> \$5,000 estimated salvage value).
    *   Obtain estimates from specialized vendors for unique items (e.g., antique furniture, specialized machinery).
    *   For general household goods, apply a standard depreciation schedule or market value assessment.
*   **Marine:** Engage marine surveyors to assess vessel and cargo damage and provide a salvage estimate.

### 3. Transfer of Ownership

For the insurer to proceed with salvage disposal, clear transfer of ownership from the insured to the insurer is mandatory.
*   **Automotive:** Obtain a signed "Total Loss Settlement and Assignment of Title" form and the vehicle's original title (or a certified copy).
*   **Property:** Obtain a signed "Proof of Loss" form and a "Release and Assignment of Salvage" document.
*   **Effective Date:** Ownership transfer is effective upon receipt of all required signed documentation and full claim payment to the insured.

## Procedures: Salvage Processing and Disposal

### 1. Salvage Notification and Assignment

Once ownership is transferred, the claims adjuster must notify the dedicated Salvage Department within 2 business days.
*   **System Entry:** Enter all relevant claim details, including estimated salvage value, property location, and damage assessment, into the "Salvage Management System" (SMS).
*   **Assignment:** The Salvage Department will assign a salvage specialist within 1 business day of notification.

### 2. Location and Recovery of Salvage

*   **Secure Storage:** Property must be moved to an approved secure storage facility (e.g., tow yard, secure warehouse) upon transfer of ownership.
*   **Documentation:** Salvage specialists will document the condition of the property (photos, detailed description) upon arrival at the storage facility.

### 3. Disposal Methods

The primary goal is to maximize net salvage recovery. The Salvage Department will determine the most appropriate disposal method.

#### a. Auction
*   **Criteria:** Most common method for vehicles, heavy equipment, and general damaged goods with broad market appeal.
*   **Process:**
    1.  List item on approved online salvage auction platforms (e.g., Copart, IAAI).
    2.  Set a reserve price based on the initial valuation and market conditions.
    3.  Monitor the bidding process.
    4.  Approve bids that meet or exceed the reserve. Bids below the reserve require Salvage Manager approval.

#### b. Direct Sale to Specialized Vendors
*   **Criteria:** For unique, specialized, or high-value items where a niche market exists (e.g., specific machinery parts, vintage items).
*   **Process:**
    1.  Obtain multiple quotes (minimum of three) from approved specialized vendors.
    2.  Select the vendor offering the highest net return.
    3.  Executed "Salvage Sales Agreement" outlining terms and conditions.

#### c. Parts Harvesting and Recycling
*   **Criteria:** For total loss vehicles or equipment where specific valuable components can be extracted and sold separately, or for properties with recyclable materials (e.g., metals, electronics).
*   **Process:**
    1.  Authorize dismantling to pre-approved parts recyclers.
    2.  Track component sales and net returns.
    3.  Ensure environmentally responsible disposal of remaining waste materials.

#### d. Destruction
*   **Criteria:** For property with no economic value, deemed a health/safety hazard, or where local regulations prohibit resale. Requires explicit approval from a Salvage Manager.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Obtain Salvage Manager approval with documented justification.
    2.  Arrange for destruction with a certified disposal company.
    3.  Obtain a "Certificate of Destruction" for records.

### 4. Financial Reconciliation

*   **Recording:** All salvage proceeds must be accurately recorded in the SMS and reconciled with the relevant claim file.
*   **Expenses:** All costs associated with salvage handling (towing, storage, valuation, disposal fees) must be tracked and deducted from gross salvage proceeds to calculate net recovery.
*   **Payment:** Salvage proceeds are applied to the claim file within 5 business days of receipt.

## Requirements/Criteria

*   **Minimum Estimated Value:** Only property with an estimated salvage value of \$100 or more will typically undergo formal salvage processing. Exceptions require documented Salvage Manager approval.
*   **Documentation:** All transfers of ownership, sales agreements, and disposal certificates must be retained in the claim file and SMS for a minimum of 7 years.
*   **Compliance:** All salvage operations must comply with local, state, and federal regulations regarding property disposal, environmental protection, and vehicle titling.
*   **Third-Party Vendors:** All vendors utilized for salvage valuation, storage, or disposal must be pre-approved by the Procurement Department and hold valid licenses and insurance.

## Exceptions

*   **Insured Retention of Salvage:** If the insured wishes to retain a total loss item, the claim settlement will be reduced by the estimated salvage value. This must be clearly documented and acknowledged in writing by the insured.
*   **Expedited Disposal:** In cases where rapid deterioration or storage costs outweigh potential salvage value, expedited disposal (potentially below the typical minimum value threshold) may be authorized by a Salvage Manager. This scenario requires a documented cost-benefit analysis.
*   **Catastrophic Events:** During large-scale catastrophic events (e.g., hurricanes, floods), adherence to all specific timelines may be relaxed, and consolidated salvage operations may be implemented under the direction of the Catastrophe Response Team.

## Examples

**Example 1: Automotive Total Loss**
A 2020 Honda Civic is involved in a severe collision. Repair estimates total \$18,000. Its Actual Cash Value (ACV) is \$22,000. Since repair costs exceed 75% of ACV (\$22,000 * 0.75 = \$16,500), it's declared a total loss. The estimated salvage value from CCC One is \$3,500. The claim is settled for \$22,000. The insured signs the title over, and the vehicle is sent to a Copart auction. It sells for \$3,400. Towing and storage costs were \$300. Net salvage recovery: \$3,100.

**Example 2: Commercial Property Salvage**
A manufacturing plant suffers a fire, resulting in heavy damage to a specialized CNC machine. The replacement cost is \$150,000, but an expert valuation determines only its control unit and certain mechanical parts are salvageable, with an estimated value of \$25,000. Through a direct sale to a specialized industrial parts dealer, the salvage is sold for \$23,000. Disposal costs for the remaining damaged frame are \$1,500. Net salvage recovery: \$21,500.

## Decision Logic

### Decision: Declaring Total Loss (Automotive)
*   **IF** (Repair Estimate / ACV) > 0.75 **THEN** Declare Total Loss.
*   **ELSE IF** (Repair Estimate + Salvage Value) > ACV **THEN** Consult with Salvage Manager for Total Loss consideration.

### Decision: Salvage Disposal Method Selection
*   **IF** (Estimated Salvage Value < \$100) **THEN** Recommend Destruction (unless exception approved).
*   **ELSE IF** (Property Type is Vehicle or Standard Equipment) **THEN** Utilize Auction.
*   **ELSE IF** (Property Type is Unique/Specialized AND Multiple Vendor Quotes Available) **THEN** Utilize Direct Sale.
*   **ELSE IF** (Property has valuable components separable from damaged bulk) **THEN** Consider Parts Harvesting.

### Decision: Accepting an Auction Bid
*   **IF** (Highest Bid >= Reserve Price) **THEN** Accept Bid.
*   **ELSE IF** (Highest Bid < Reserve Price AND Highest Bid >= 80% of Reserve Price) **THEN** Seek Salvage Manager Approval.
*   **ELSE** Re-list for auction or explore alternative disposal methods.
