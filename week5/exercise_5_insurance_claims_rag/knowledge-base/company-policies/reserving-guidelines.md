# Claims Reserving Guidelines

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This document establishes the official policy and guidelines for the establishment, review, and adjustment of all claims reserves within the organization. The primary purpose of these guidelines is to ensure that claims reserves are held at an adequate level to meet future obligations arising from incurred losses, accurately reflect the company's financial position, comply with regulatory requirements, and support sound business decision-making. Proper reserving ensures financial stability, accurate profit assessment, and fair treatment of policyholders.

## 2. Scope

These guidelines apply to all departments, units, and personnel involved in the claims handling process, actuarial analysis, financial reporting, and external audit functions. This includes, but is not limited to, Claims Adjusters, Claims Supervisors, Claims Managers, Actuarial Services, and the Finance Department.
The policy covers all lines of business (e.g., Auto, Property, Liability, Workers' Compensation) and all types of claims reserves, including case reserves, incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserves, and incurred but not enough reported (IBNER) reserves.

### 2.1 Exclusions from Scope

This policy does not cover premium reserves or unearned premium reserves, which are addressed in separate financial accounting policies.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Claim Reserve:** An estimate of the amount of money an insurer will require to pay for reported and unreported claims, including associated expenses.
*   **Case Reserve:** A specific estimate of the future cost of a reported claim as determined by a claims adjuster or specialist based on the known facts of the claim at a given point in time.
*   **Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) Reserve:** An actuarial estimate of the liability for claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to the insurer.
*   **Incurred But Not Enough Reported (IBNER) Reserve:** An actuarial estimate for development on reported claims where the current case reserves are deemed insufficient to cover the ultimate cost. Often combined with IBNR for reporting purposes.
*   **Ultimate Loss:** The total cost of a claim, including all payments made and all future payments to be made.
*   **Actuarial Soundness:** The principle that reserves are adequate, neither materially deficient nor excessive, and are determined using generally accepted actuarial principles and practices.
*   **Reserving Methodologies:** Statistical or actuarial techniques used to estimate ultimate losses and unearned premiums.
*   **Triangles (Loss Development Triangles):** A common actuarial tool used to display historical loss data by accident year/period and development year/period to estimate future development.

## 4. Reserving Principles and Requirements

All claims reserves shall adhere to the following principles:

### 4.1 Adequacy
Reserves must be established at a level sufficient to prudently cover the ultimate cost of all incurred claims, including loss adjustment expenses (LAE). Over-reserving should be avoided as it can impact profitability metrics, but under-reserving is strictly prohibited due to its significant financial and regulatory implications.

### 4.2 Timeliness
Case reserves must be set or reviewed within 7 calendar days of a claim's initial report or any significant change in claim status (e.g., new medical report, liability determination, litigation update). Actuarial reserves (IBNR) shall be reviewed and adjusted monthly.

### 4.3 Documentation
All reserve decisions, including initial estimates, adjustments, and the rationale supporting them, must be clearly documented in the claims management system. For actuarial reserves, detailed methodological documentation and assumption justifications are required.

### 4.4 Objectivity
Reserves must be determined based on objective evidence, professional judgment, and analysis of all available information, free from undue influence or bias.

### 4.5 Consistency
Reserving methods and assumptions should be applied consistently across similar claims and over time, unless a material change in claims patterns, business environment, or regulatory requirements necessitates a change, which must be fully justified and documented.

### 4.6 Compliance
All reserving activities must comply with applicable state and federal insurance regulations, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), and Statutory Accounting Principles (SAP).

## 5. Types of Reserves and Methodology

### 5.1 Case Reserves (Claims Department Responsibility)

#### 5.1.1 Establishment Criteria
Case reserves are established for each reported claim that is not certain to be a "No-Pay" or "Denial." They should reflect the best estimate of the ultimate payment based on the current facts.

#### 5.1.2 Decision Logic
Adjusters use a combination of historical loss data, established pricing matrices for specific injuries/damages, legal opinions, medical reports, repair estimates, and policy limits.
*   **Minor Claims (e.g., fender benders with no injuries, property damage < $5,000):** Adjusters may apply standard reserve amounts based on historical averages and department guidelines.
*   **Moderate Claims (e.g., whiplash, property damage $5,000 - $25,000):** Adjusters must perform a detailed analysis, obtaining quotes/estimates and considering potential medical treatment costs. Supervisory review (Level 1) is required for reserves exceeding $15,000.
*   **Severe/Complex Claims (e.g., catastrophic injury, total loss property, litigation, property damage > $25,000):** Requires comprehensive individual analysis, often involving legal counsel and medical experts. Supervisory review (Level 2) and/or Claims Manager approval is mandatory for reserves exceeding $50,000.
*   **Litigated Claims:** Reserves must include estimated legal defense costs in addition to anticipated indemnity. Legal counsel estimates must be documented.

#### 5.1.3 Review and Adjustment
Case reserves must be reviewed at least every 90 days for open claims. More frequent reviews are required upon:
*   Receipt of new medical reports (e.g., significant diagnosis change, surgery recommendation, MMI determination).
*   Receipt of new repair/replacement estimates (e.g., hidden damage discovery).
*   Changes in liability assessment.
*   Initiation or conclusion of litigation.
*   Settlement negotiations.
*   Any event that materially impacts the potential ultimate cost of the claim by more than 10% or $5,000, whichever is greater.

### 5.2 IBNR and IBNER Reserves (Actuarial Services Responsibility)

#### 5.2.1 Methodology
Actuarial Services will use generally accepted actuarial reserving techniques to estimate IBNR and IBNER liabilities. Common methodologies include:
*   **Loss Development Method (LDM):** Uses historical loss development factors to project ultimate losses.
*   **Bornhuetter-Ferguson Method (BFM):** Combines reported losses with an a priori estimate for undeveloped losses.
*   **Frequency-Severity Method:** Projects ultimate frequency and average severity.
*   **Expected Loss Ratio Method:** Applies an expected loss ratio to earned premiums.

The selection of appropriate methods depends on the maturity of the data, line of business, and data characteristics. Multiple methods should typically be used, with the final estimate reflecting a weighted average or a range based on professional judgment, considering the strengths and weaknesses of each method.

#### 5.2.2 Data Inputs
Actuarial analysis will utilize accurate and complete claims data, including:
*   Paid losses, reported case reserves, and loss adjustment expenses.
*   Earned premiums.
*   Policy limits and deductibles.
*   Claim counts (reported and closed).
*   Exposure data.

#### 5.2.3 Assumptions
Key assumptions used in actuarial reserving models must be explicitly documented and reviewed quarterly. These include:
*   **Loss Development Factors (LDFs):** Based on historical data, adjusted for known changes in claims handling, policy terms, economic conditions, or legal environment.
*   **Trend Assumptions:** For severity and frequency.
*   **Discount Rates:** If reserves are discounted (e.g., Workers' Compensation annuities, specific long-term liabilities).
*   **IBNR emergence patterns.**

#### 5.2.4 Review and Adjustment
IBNR and IBNER reserves shall be calculated and reviewed monthly as part of the financial close process. Significant adjustments (defined as more than a 5% change from the prior month's estimate or exceeding a pre-defined threshold of $1,000,000 per line of business) require formal documentation of the rationale and approval by the Chief Actuary and CFO.

### 5.3 Loss Adjustment Expense (LAE) Reserves

Separate reserves for Loss Adjustment Expenses (LAE) must be established alongside indemnity reserves. This includes:
*   **Allocated LAE (ALAE):** Specific expenses directly attributable to a claim (e.g., legal fees, independent adjuster fees, expert witness costs). These are typically reserved as part of the case reserve.
*   **Unallocated LAE (ULAE):** Expenses not directly attributable to specific claims but part of the overall claims handling process (e.g., claims department salaries, overhead). ULAE reserves are typically estimated actuarially using historical ratios to paid or incurred losses.

## 6. Approvals and Oversight

### 6.1 Claims Department Approvals
| Reserve Level (Case Reserve) | Required Approver(s) | Review Cycle |
| :--------------------------- | :------------------- | :----------- |
| $0 - $14,999                 | Claims Adjuster      | Ad-hoc       |
| $15,000 - $49,999            | Supervisor (Level 1) | Bi-annually  |
| $50,000 - $249,999           | Claims Manager       | Annually     |
| $250,000+                    | Chief Claims Officer | Annually     |

Any change to a reserve amount exceeding 20% of the prior reserve or $10,000 (whichever is lower) requires approval from the next higher authority.

### 6.2 Actuarial Approvals
Monthly IBNR and IBNER reserve calculations are approved by the Chief Actuary. Any material deviations (as defined in Section 5.2.4) or changes in methodology require joint approval from the Chief Actuary and Chief Financial Officer (CFO).

### 6.3 Independent Review
An independent actuarial firm or an internal audit team will perform an annual review of the company’s reserving practices, methodologies, and assumptions to ensure actuarial soundness and compliance. Findings and recommendations from these reviews must be addressed by senior management.

## 7. Reporting and Communication

### 7.1 Internal Reporting
Regular reports on reserve adequacy, development, and variances will be provided to the Claims Department, Finance Department, Executive Committee, and the Board of Directors.
*   **Monthly:** Claims Reserve Development Report (Actuarial), Large Loss Reserve Changes (Claims).
*   **Quarterly:** Detailed IBNR Analysis, Reserving Committee meeting minutes.

### 7.2 External Reporting
Reserves will be reported in accordance with regulatory requirements (e.g., NAIC Annual Statement for SAP) and financial reporting standards (GAAP).

## 8. Exceptions

Any deviation from these guidelines requires prior written approval from the Chief Claims Officer or Chief Actuary (depending on the type of reserve) and the Chief Financial Officer. Such exceptions will only be granted under extraordinary circumstances and must be fully documented with clear justification.

## 9. Training and Education

All claims personnel responsible for setting or reviewing case reserves and all actuarial staff involved in IBNR calculations must undergo mandatory annual training on these guidelines, reserving best practices, and relevant regulatory updates. New hires will receive comprehensive training within their first 30 days of employment.

## 10. Policy Review

These Claims Reserving Guidelines will be reviewed and updated annually by the Actuarial Services and Claims Departments, in conjunction with the Finance Department, or more frequently as necessitated by changes in regulatory requirements, business operations, or market conditions. The effective date of the latest approved version is noted in the front matter.
