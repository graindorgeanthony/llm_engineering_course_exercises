Failure to implement agreed-upon CAPs may result in penalties, suspension of new claim assignments, or contract termination.

## 8. Exceptions

Any request for an exception to this policy must be submitted in writing to the Head of AIG Claims Department, detailing the specific circumstances and justification. Exceptions will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and only granted if they do not compromise AIG's regulatory compliance, financial integrity, or claimant experience. All approved exceptions must be documented and signed by the Head of AIG Claims Department. Examples of potential exceptions include urgent, short-term engagements for catastrophic events, or highly specialized claims requiring unique expertise not covered by standard TPA agreements.

## 9. Training and Development

TPAs are required to ensure their staff handling AIG claims are adequately trained on AIG's specific policies, procedures, and systems. AIG will provide initial and ongoing training modules, as well as access to documentation. TPAs are responsible for maintaining records of their employees' training completion.

## 10. Policy Review

This policy will be reviewed annually by the AIG Claims Department and the Legal Department, or sooner if significant changes in business operations, regulatory requirements, or risk profiles necessitate an update. Any amendments will be promptly communicated to all affected parties, including existing TPAs.
