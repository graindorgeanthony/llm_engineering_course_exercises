## 5. Complaint Investigation and Resolution

### 5.1. Assignment and Review

    *   Understand the core issue(s).

*   Requesting additional information or clarification from the complainant (if necessary).
*   Analyzing applicable policy terms, regulatory guidelines, and company procedures.

### 5.3. Decision Logic and Resolution Criteria

### 5.4. Communication of Resolution

1.  **Draft Resolution Letter:** The CHO will draft a comprehensive resolution letter detailing the findings of the investigation, the decision reached, the rationale behind the decision, and any proposed corrective actions or remedies.
2.  **Internal Review:** The resolution letter will be reviewed by a senior manager or designated compliance officer prior to dispatch, especially for complex or high-risk complaints.
3.  **Dispatch:** The resolution letter will be sent to the complainant within **15 working days** from the initial acknowledgment date, unless exceptional circumstances require an extension. If an extension is needed, the complainant must be informed in writing, stating the reason for delay and the new estimated resolution date (not exceeding 30 working days from initial acknowledgment).

## 6. Exceptions

*   **Complaints involving alleged fraud or criminal activity:** These will be immediately escalated to the Legal and Fraud Investigation Departments, operating under specific protocols. The complainant will be notified that the matter has been escalated.
*   **Complaints requiring significant external expert input (e.g., medical, engineering):** The 15-working-day timeline may be extended. The complainant will be proactively informed of the delay and estimated new resolution timeline.
*   **Complaints from vulnerable customers:** These complaints will be prioritized and handled with increased sensitivity and support, ensuring communication is clear and accessible.
