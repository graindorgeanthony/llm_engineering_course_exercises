Coverage Verification Policy
Document ID: CP-102
Effective Date: 2024-01-01
Version: 1.0

Purpose
Ensure coverage is verified early to prevent delays, reduce leakage, and set accurate expectations.

Scope
All claims across personal and commercial lines.

Policy
1. CP-102-P1: Coverage must be verified within 1 business day of claim intake.
2. CP-102-P2: Adjusters must review policy status, effective dates, deductibles, and applicable endorsements.
3. CP-102-P3: Any potential coverage issue must be escalated to the Coverage Review Team within 24 hours.
4. CP-102-P4: Partial coverage determinations must be documented with rationale and referenced policy language.
5. CP-102-P5: Claimant communications must include a plain-language explanation of coverage findings.

Decision Criteria
- CP-102-DC1: IF policy status is inactive OR loss date is outside policy effective dates THEN deny coverage and issue a coverage determination notice.
- CP-102-DC2: IF a deductible applies THEN reduce payable amount by deductible and document in the coverage determination.
- CP-102-DC3: IF endorsements or exclusions limit coverage THEN approve only the covered portion and cite specific policy language.

Documentation Requirements
- Coverage checklist completed in the claims system.
- Copies of relevant declarations and endorsements attached to the claim file.

Records and Retention
Coverage analysis documentation retained for 7 years.
