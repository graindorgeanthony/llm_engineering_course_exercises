# Agent/Broker Claims Interaction Policy

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This policy outlines the standardized procedures and acceptable communication protocols for interactions between the Company's Claims Department personnel and external agents/brokers regarding insurance claims. The purpose of this policy is to ensure consistent, efficient, and compliant claims handling, maintain clear roles and responsibilities, protect sensitive information, and enhance the overall client experience. By establishing clear guidelines, we aim to streamline communication, reduce potential misunderstandings, and expedite the claims resolution process while adhering to regulatory requirements and internal standards.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all claims personnel within the Company's Claims Department, including adjusters, supervisors, claims managers, and support staff. It also applies to all external independent agents and brokers who submit claims on behalf of policyholders or inquire about claim status. This policy covers all lines of business where agents/brokers are involved in the claims process, including personal lines, commercial lines, and specialty coverages.

### 2.1. Inclusions

*   Communication regarding claim status inquiries.
*   Submission of claims documentation by agents/brokers.
*   Disclosure of claim-related information to agents/brokers.
*   Escalation procedures involving agents/brokers.
*   Handling of agent/broker complaints or inquiries about claims decisions.

### 2.2. Exclusions

*   Direct communication between policyholders and agents/brokers outside of claims adjudication.
*   Marketing or sales-related interactions.
*   Underwriting policy questions not directly related to an active claim.
*   Legal advice provided by company counsel to agents/brokers.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Agent/Broker (A/B):** An independent party authorized to sell or service insurance policies on behalf of the Company and act as an intermediary between the Company and the policyholder.
*   **Claims Department (CD):** The Company division responsible for processing, investigating, and resolving insurance claims.
*   **Claim Representative (CR):** Any individual within the Claims Department assigned to manage a specific claim, including adjusters and claims examiners.
*   **Policyholder:** The individual or entity insured under an active insurance policy.
*   **Claim File:** The complete record of all information, documents, and communications pertaining to a specific insurance claim.
*   **Confidential Information:** Non-public personal information or proprietary business information of the Company or policyholders.

## 4. Main Content: Communication Protocols

### 4.1. General Principles

*   **Transparency:** Provide clear, factual, and timely information to agents/brokers, subject to privacy restrictions.
*   **Professionalism:** All interactions must be conducted with respect, courtesy, and professionalism.
*   **Efficiency:** Strive for prompt responses and efficient resolution of inquiries.
*   **Documentation:** All substantive communications regarding a claim must be documented in the claim file.

### 4.2. Authorized Communication Channels

The following channels are approved for claims-related communication between the Claims Department and agents/brokers:

*   **Claims Portal:** Preferred method for status inquiries, document submission, and general communication. Provides secure, auditable record.
*   **Email:** For non-urgent inquiries, document sharing (via secure links where sensitive data is involved), or follow-up communications. Must use official company email addresses.
*   **Telephone:** For urgent inquiries, detailed discussions, or when direct interaction is necessary. Calls should be logged in the claim file.
*   **Fax/Mail:** For submission of original documents or when electronic methods are not feasible.

### 4.3. Information Disclosure Guidelines

Claims Representatives are authorized to disclose the following information to the agent/broker of record for a specific policy, provided the policyholder has not explicitly requested otherwise:

*   Claim number and date of loss.
*   Current claim status (e.g., "Under Review," "Investigation Pending," "Payment Issued").

*   An estimated timeframe for next steps or resolution, if available.
*   Requests for additional information or documentation from the policyholder.

### 4.4. Prohibited Information Disclosure

Claims Representatives **must not** disclose the following sensitive or confidential information to agents/brokers without explicit written policyholder consent or a legal directive:

*   Detailed medical information (HIPAA-protected).
*   Specific financial details of settlements or payments (e.g., exact dollar amounts paid to third parties, unless it directly impacts the policyholder's deductible or benefits).
*   Internal investigation notes or adjuster's personal opinions.
*   Information that could compromise the integrity of an ongoing investigation (e.g., specific findings of fraud investigation).
*   Proprietary Company litigation strategy.
*   Any information deemed "Highly Confidential" by the policyholder.

## 5. Requirements and Criteria for Interaction

### 5.1. Agent/Broker Identification

Before disclosing any claim-specific information, the Claims Representative must verify the identity of the agent/broker. This can be done by:

*   Matching the caller's or sender's contact information (email/phone) to the agent/broker of record in the Company's system.
*   Requesting the agent/broker's license number or agency ID.
*   Validating the policy number and claim number provided by the agent/broker.

### 5.2. Policyholder Consent

If a policyholder has requested that their agent/broker not be privy to claim details, or if the disclosure involves sensitive data beyond routine status updates, the Claims Representative must:

*   Obtain explicit written consent from the policyholder, specifically authorizing the release of information to their agent/broker. This consent should be dated and kept in the claim file.
*   Confirm the scope of the consent (e.g., specific types of information, for a specific period).

### 5.3. Documentation Standards

All claim-related interactions with agents/brokers must be documented in the claim file notes, including:

*   Date and time of interaction.
*   Method of communication (e.g., phone, email, portal).
*   Name of the Agent/Broker and their agency.
*   Summary of the discussion/inquiry.
*   Information provided or requested.
*   Any commitments made or actions agreed upon.

## 6. Procedures for Specific Interactions

### 6.1. Claim Status Inquiries

1.  **Receipt:** Agent/Broker submits inquiry via Claims Portal, email, or telephone.
2.  **Verification:** CR verifies Agent/Broker identity and entitlement to information (Section 5.1, 5.2).
3.  **Response:** CR provides current claim status and anticipated next steps, adhering to disclosure guidelines (Sections 4.3, 4.4).
4.  **Documentation:** CR logs interaction, including details, in the claim file.
5.  **Target Response Time:** Aim to respond to status inquiries within 2 business days via portal/email, or immediately if by phone (unless further investigation is required). If more time is needed, CR must communicate this to the A/B.

### 6.2. Submission of Documentation

1.  **Receipt:** Agent/Broker submits documents (e.g., photos, police reports, statements) via Claims Portal (preferred), email, fax, or mail.
2.  **Acknowledgement:** CR acknowledges receipt of documents within 1 business day, via the same channel or Claims Portal.
3.  **Uploading:** CR uploads all documents to the claim file promptly.
4.  **Review:** CR reviews documents and, if further information is needed, communicates this to the A/B or policyholder directly, as appropriate.

### 6.3. Claims Escalation by Agent/Broker

1.  **Initial Contact:** Agent/Broker contacts the assigned CR with a concern or complaint.
2.  **CR Resolution Attempt:** CR attempts to resolve the issue directly, providing full explanation and context.
3.  **Escalation Trigger:** If the issue remains unresolved after the CR's attempt, or if the agent requests escalation, the CR shall refer the A/B to their immediate Claims Supervisor.
4.  **Supervisor Review:** The Claims Supervisor will review the claim file and discuss the issue with the A/B, aiming for resolution within 3 business days of escalation.
5.  **Further Escalation:** If the Supervisor cannot resolve the issue, it may be escalated to the Claims Manager. This level of escalation should be reserved for complex disputes or policy interpretation issues.

## 7. Exceptions

*   **Urgent Care/Emergency Claims:** In cases of severe injury or property damage requiring immediate attention, standard response times may be expedited. CRs should prioritize these communications.
*   **Legal Action:** If a claim enters litigation, communication protocols may be modified upon advice from Company Legal Counsel, potentially limiting direct contact with agents/brokers regarding specific details of the suit.
*   **Third-Party Administrator (TPA) Claims:** For claims handled by a TPA, communication protocols are governed by the specific TPA agreement, but the spirit of transparency and efficiency outlined in this policy still applies. Agents/brokers should be directed to the TPA for inquiries, with the Company maintaining oversight.

## 8. Decision Logic: Access to Information

The decision to provide information to an agent/broker is based on the following hierarchy:

1.  **Is the Agent/Broker of Record?** Yes / No
    *   If No: Information CANNOT be provided without explicit policyholder consent.
    *   If Yes: Proceed to step 2.
2.  **Does the disclosure involve "Prohibited Information" (Section 4.4)?** Yes / No
    *   If Yes: Information CANNOT be provided without explicit, documented policyholder consent AND validation of the scope of that consent. If consent is not obtained or insufficient, refer A/B to the policyholder.
    *   If No: Proceed to step 3.
3.  **Has the Policyholder requested Non-Disclosure to the Agent/Broker?** Yes / No
    *   If Yes: Information CANNOT be provided. Refer A/B inquiries to the policyholder.
    *   If No: Information CAN be provided, adhering to "Information Disclosure Guidelines" (Section 4.3).

## 9. Evidence/Documentation

All records pertaining to agent/broker claims interactions, including email correspondence, call notes, portal messages, and policyholder consent forms, must be securely maintained within the electronic claim file for a minimum of seven (7) years or as required by state and federal regulations, whichever is longer.

## 10. Timelines

*   **Acknowledgement of Documents:** Within 1 business day.
*   **Claim Status Inquiry Response (Non-Urgent):** Within 2 business days.
*   **A/B Escalation to Supervisor:** Within 3 business days of transfer.
*   **Policyholder Consent for Disclosure:** To be obtained and documented before sensitive information is released.
*   **Documentation Retention:** Minimum 7 years.
