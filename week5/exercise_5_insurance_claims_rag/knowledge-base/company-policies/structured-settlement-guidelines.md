# Structured Settlement Guidelines

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This policy outlines the guidelines and procedures for offering, evaluating, and administering structured settlements for eligible claims. The purpose of structured settlements is to provide a claimant with a series of periodic payments, often tax-free, in lieu of a single lump-sum payment, particularly in cases involving long-term personal injury, wrongful death, or other claims requiring long-term financial support. This approach aims to ensure long-term financial security for claimants while effectively managing claim liabilities for the company.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all claims personnel, legal teams, and external counsel involved in the negotiation and resolution of personal injury, wrongful death, and other eligible claims that may benefit from a structured settlement. It covers claims originating from all lines of business where such settlements are legally permissible and financially prudent.

### 2.1. Inclusions

*   Long-term personal injury claims (e.g., permanent disability, catastrophic injury)
*   Wrongful death claims
*   Medical malpractice claims
*   Any claim where a claimant's ongoing financial needs are a primary consideration
*   Claims with settlement values exceeding $250,000 for periodic payments or $1,000,000 total projected payout.

### 2.2. Exclusions

*   Claims settled exclusively as a single lump-sum payment without periodic components.
*   Claims fully litigated to a final judgment where no settlement option is presented.
*   Short-term disability claims or claims for property damage only.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Structured Settlement:** A financial or annuity arrangement where a claimant receives a series of periodic payments, usually tax-free, instead of a single lump-sum payment, often funded by an annuity purchased from a highly-rated life insurance company.
*   **Annuity:** A financial product offered by life insurance companies that provides a series of payments over a specified period or for the life of the annuitant(s).
*   **Claimant:** The individual or entity receiving the settlement payments.
*   **Assignee:** A third-party entity (typically a structured settlement factoring company) that takes on the liability for making periodic payments on behalf of the defendant/insurer, funded by an annuity.
*   **Qualified Settlement Fund (QSF):** A special trust account established to hold settlement funds for a period while the structured settlement details are finalized, especially when multiple claimants or complex payment structures are involved.
*   **Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA):** An increase in periodic payments designed to offset the effects of inflation.

## 4. Eligibility and Recommendation Criteria

Structured settlements are recommended when they provide significant benefits to the claimant and/or the company.

### 4.1. Claimant Benefit Criteria

*   **Long-Term Needs:** The claimant has ongoing medical, care, or living expenses due to the injury or death.
*   **Financial Prudence:** The claimant (or their guardian/attorney) recognizes the benefit of managing funds over time rather than a single large sum.
*   **Tax Benefits:** The payments are eligible for exclusion from gross income under Internal Revenue Code Section 104(a)(2) for physical injury/sickness, or other applicable codes.
*   **Spendthrift Protection:** Protection against rapid dissipation of funds, particularly for minors or individuals with limited financial management experience.

### 4.2. Company Benefit Criteria

*   **Risk Management:** Transfers investment risk and administrative burden to a life insurance company.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** Can sometimes result in a lower actual cost to the company compared to a lump sum settlement of equal benefit to the claimant.
*   **Public Relations:** Demonstrates a commitment to responsible, long-term care for claimants.
*   **Reduced Litigation:** May facilitate settlement in complex cases, avoiding prolonged litigation.

### 4.3. Specific Conditions for Consideration

*   Claims involving minors.
*   Cases where Medicare Set-Aside (MSA) or Special Needs Trusts (SNT) are required.
*   Claimants receiving means-tested government benefits (e.g., Medicaid, SSI) where a structured settlement can help preserve eligibility.
*   Cases where a structured special needs trust is deemed appropriate by legal counsel.

## 5. Procedure for Offering and Implementing Structured Settlements

### 5.1. Initial Assessment (Claim Adjuster)

1.  **Identify Potential Cases:** Adjusters must flag claims meeting the eligibility criteria in Section 4 during the claims evaluation process.
2.  **Document Rationale:** Record in the claim file why a structured settlement is being considered (e.g., "Catastrophic injury, long-term care needs, claimant is a minor").
3.  **Discuss with Claimant/Counsel:** Explore the claimant's interest in periodic payments and explain the basic concept without providing financial advice.

### 5.2. Internal Review and Approval (Claim Manager)

1.  **Submit Recommendation:** The adjuster submits a Structured Settlement Recommendation Form (Form CS-301) to the Claim Manager.
2.  **Managerial Approval:** Claim Manager reviews the recommendation, ensuring it aligns with policy guidelines and budget considerations. Approval is required for proceeding.

### 5.3. Engagement of Structured Settlement Consultant

1.  **Preferred Vendor List:** Utilize approved structured settlement consulting firms from the corporate vendor list (refer to Finance Department Vendor List, Section IV.B for current list).
2.  **Request Proposals:** The claim team, in conjunction with the consultant, develops payment scenarios (e.g., monthly income for life, lump sums at specific ages, periodic medical payments).
3.  **Consultant Role:** The consultant obtains proposals from highly-rated life insurance companies (A.M. Best rating of A- or higher) and assists in customizing payment streams.

### 5.4. Negotiation with Claimant/Counsel

1.  **Presenter:** The adjuster, legal counsel, or structured settlement consultant presents the structured settlement proposals to the claimant and their attorney.
2.  **Explain Benefits:** Clearly articulate the tax benefits, security, and long-term financial planning aspects of the proposed structure.
3.  **Documentation:** All proposals, counter-proposals, and communications related to structured settlement offers must be meticulously documented in the claim file.

### 5.5. Final Approval and Documentation

1.  **Settlement Agreement:** Once terms are agreed upon, a comprehensive settlement agreement must be drafted by legal counsel. This agreement must
    *   Explicitly state the periodic payment schedule and amounts.
    *   Identify the annuity issuer and the assignee (if applicable).
    *   Include language releasing the company from future liability for the structured portion of the claim.
    *   Contain language ensuring IRC Section 104(a)(2) compliance where applicable.
2.  **Court Approval (if applicable):** For minors or incapacitated claimants, court approval of the structured settlement is mandatory. Legal counsel will manage this process.
3.  **Funding:** Upon final agreement and court approval (if required), the company will transfer the lump sum required to purchase the annuity to the chosen life insurance company or assignee.
4.  **Confirmation:** Obtain confirmation from the annuity issuer that the annuity has been purchased and payments are scheduled to begin as agreed.

## 6. Exceptions

*   Any deviation from the use of approved structured settlement consultants requires explicit approval from the Director of Claims Operations.
*   In urgent cases (e.g., terminally ill claimant requiring immediate funds), a fast-tracked approval process may be initiated with written justification and approval from Area Vice President of Claims.
*   For settlement offers below the $250,000 threshold, a structured settlement may still be considered if compelling claimant circumstances or significant cost savings are demonstrated and approved by the Claim Manager.

## 7. Evidence and Documentation

The following documents *must* be maintained in the claim file:

*   Structured Settlement Recommendation Form (Form CS-301).
*   Claim Manager approval documentation.
*   Proposals from structured settlement consultants and annuity issuers.
*   Correspondence with claimant/counsel regarding structured settlement options.
*   Final Settlement Agreement.
*   Court Order approving the settlement (if applicable).
*   Annuity Policy or Assignment Agreement.
*   Proof of funding the annuity.
*   Receipts for any cash portion of the settlement.

## 8. Timelines

*   **Initial Assessment to Consultant Engagement:** Within 5 business days of identifying a suitable case.
*   **Proposals from Consultant:** Within 3 business days of receiving all necessary claimant data.
*   **Claimant/Counsel Review & Decision:** Target 10-15 business days, highly dependent on external parties.
*   **Final Documentation & Funding:** Within 30 business days of agreed-upon terms, contingent on court approval timelines if applicable.
