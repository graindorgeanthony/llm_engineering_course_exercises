## 1. Overview and Purpose

This policy establishes the company's commitment to preventing, detecting, investigating, and reporting all forms of insurance fraud. Its purpose is to define the responsibilities of employees, outline procedures for identifying suspicious claims, and ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations concerning fraud. Effective fraud management protects our policyholders, maintains financial integrity, and upholds the company's reputation.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, agents, and third-party administrators ("TPA") involved in the claims handling process, underwriting, sales, and any other business operations that may encounter or be affected by fraudulent activities. It covers all lines of business, including but not limited to auto, property, life, and disability insurance claims. This policy is applicable to both internal fraud (perpetrated by employees, agents, or vendors against the company) and external fraud (perpetrated by policyholders or third parties against the company).

### 2.1. Inclusions
*   Detection of suspicious claim indicators
*   Reporting procedures for identified suspicious activities
*   Investigation protocols for suspected fraud
*   Compliance with state and federal anti-fraud statutes

### 2.2. Exclusions
*   Detailed operational procedures for specific investigative techniques (these are covered in the "Claims Fraud Investigation Procedures" manual)
*   Disciplinary actions for employees involved in fraud (covered under "Employee Conduct Policy")

## 3. Definitions

*   **Fraud:** Any intentional deception or misrepresentation made by a person with the knowledge that the deception could result in some unauthorized benefit to themselves or some other person. For insurance purposes, this often involves false statements, misrepresentations, or omissions of material facts to obtain an insurance policy, receive benefits, or avoid payment.
*   **Suspicious Activity Report (SAR):** An internal document generated when a claim or activity exhibits one or more indicators of potential fraud, warranting further investigation.
*   **Special Investigations Unit (SIU):** A specialized department or team responsible for investigating suspected insurance fraud.
*   **Material Misrepresentation:** A false statement of fact which, if known, would have caused the insurer to decline the policy, charge a higher premium, or alter the terms of the policy.
*   **Referral:** The act of formally transferring a suspicious claim or activity to the SIU for further review and investigation.
*   **Insurer:** Refers to [Your Company Name].

## 4. Main Content: Fraud Detection and Identification

All employees are required to be vigilant in identifying potential fraud. Indicators of fraud can arise at any stage of the insurance process – from application to claim payment.

### 4.1. Common Fraud Indicators

Employees should be alert to the following red flags, though this list is not exhaustive:

#### 4.1.1. Application Fraud
*   Incomplete or inconsistent information provided on the application.
*   Application details that conflict with publicly available information or credit reports.
*   Multiple applications for similar coverage from the same individual or related parties.
*   Lack of verifiable contact information or frequent changes in personal details.

#### 4.1.2. Claim Fraud (General)
*   Disproportionate claim amount relative to the reported incident or policy coverage.
*   Claim submitted immediately after policy inception or a significant policy change.
*   Claimant exhibiting unusual familiarity with insurance procedures or jargon.
*   Reluctance to provide documentation or unusually high pressure for quick settlement.
*   Claimant or involved parties have a history of prior claims, especially suspicious or fraudulent ones.

#### 4.1.3. Auto Claims Fraud
*   Staged accidents (e.g., "swoop and squat," "phantom rear-end").
*   Faked theft where the vehicle is later found undamaged.
*   Exaggerated injuries or property damage for minor incidents.
*   Multiple occupants claiming injury from a minor impact.
*   Repair shops recommending unnecessary or exaggerated repairs.
*   Claimant changing their story frequently or providing inconsistent details.

#### 4.1.4. Property Claims Fraud
*   Inflated values for damaged or stolen items.
*   Claim involving items recently purchased (especially if cash-only).
*   Claim following a natural disaster where damage does not align with the event.
*   Suspicious timing (e.g., claim for property damage just before foreclosing on home).
*   Arson for profit or to destroy evidence.
*   Lack of clear evidence for alleged property damage or theft.

#### 4.1.5. Life/Disability Claims Fraud
*   Suspicious circumstances surrounding death (e.g., suicide within contestability period, beneficiary having motive).
*   Disability claim filed shortly after policy issue or job loss.
*   Claimant refusing independent medical examinations (IMEs).
*   Disability conflicting with observed activities (e.g., working while claiming total disability).

## 5. Decision Logic for Referral to SIU

Any employee who identifies one or more fraud indicators, or has a reasonable suspicion of fraud, must initiate a **Suspicious Activity Report (SAR)**.

### 5.1. Referral Thresholds and Criteria

A claim **must** be referred to the SIU if it meets any of the following criteria:

*   **Financial Threshold:** Potential loss or indemnity payout exceeds **$10,000** and exhibits any two fraud indicators.
*   **Specific Fraud Schemes:** Appears to involve organized fraud, rings, "capping," or provider fraud (e.g., medical clinics, auto repair shops).
*   **Intentional Misrepresentation:** Clear evidence of deliberate false statements, omissions, or misrepresentations of material facts with intent to deceive for financial gain.
*   **Prior Fraud History:** Claimant or related parties have a confirmed history of prior fraudulent claims or arrests/convictions for fraud.
*   **Arson:** Any claim involving suspected arson.
*   **Employee/Agent Involvement:** Any suspicion that an employee, agent, or vendor of the company is involved in the fraudulent activity.
*   **Law Enforcement Involvement:** Police or other law enforcement agencies have initiated an investigation related to the claim.
*   **Pattern of Behavior:** Multiple suspicious claims from the same claimant, address, or medical provider within a 12-month period.

Claims not meeting the above mandatory referral criteria, but still exhibiting at least **three distinct fraud indicators**, should also be referred to SIU for review and potential investigation.

## 6. Procedures for Reporting Suspected Fraud

### 6.1. Step 1: Document Suspicion
When an employee encounters an indicator of fraud, they must document their observations and the specific indicators identified. This should be done within the relevant claim file system, clearly marking the claim as "Suspected Fraud - Pending Review."

### 6.2. Step 2: Complete Suspicious Activity Report (SAR)
Within **2 business days** of identifying a reasonable suspicion of fraud, the employee must complete an internal Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) form. This form is available on the company intranet under "Fraud Prevention Resources." The SAR must include:
*   Claim number and policy details
*   Date of identification
*   Specific fraud indicators observed
*   Summary of facts and circumstances supporting the suspicion
*   Any relevant dates, names, locations, and involved parties
*   Employee's contact information

### 6.3. Step 3: Referral to SIU
The completed SAR, along with all supporting documentation, must be electronically submitted to the SIU via the dedicated SIU portal. A confirmation email will be sent to the submitting employee upon successful submission.

### 6.4. Step 4: SIU Review and Action
Upon receipt of an SAR, the SIU will review the submitted information within **3 business days**. The SIU will then:
*   **Acknowledge Receipt:** Send an acknowledgment to the referring employee.
*   **Categorize:** Assess the claim for a full investigation, further preliminary inquiry, or closure if suspicion is unfounded.
*   **Notify:** Inform the referring department (e.g., Claims, Underwriting) of the decision to proceed with or close the referral.
*   **Initiate Investigation:** If a full investigation is warranted, the SIU will take over primary responsibility for the claim investigation specific to the fraud allegations.

## 7. Evidence and Documentation Requirements

All documentation related to a suspicious claim must be meticulously maintained. This includes:
*   Original claim forms and applications
*   Policy documents
*   Communication logs (phone calls, emails, letters)
*   Medical records, police reports, repair estimates
*   Witness statements
*   Photographs, videos, and audio recordings
*   Any internal notes, observations, and analytical reports generated during the review process
*   Completed SAR forms and SIU referral documents

All evidence must be original or certified copies, if possible. Digital evidence must be preserved according to established chain-of-custody protocols.

## 8. Exceptions

*   In cases where an immediate threat to life or property is identified, standard emergency procedures should be followed in conjunction with timely fraud reporting.
*   Minor discrepancies or errors that are clearly unintentional and do not suggest an intent to deceive, and do not meet the referral thresholds, should be handled through standard claims processing, with documentation of the discrepancy. Review by a supervisor is still recommended for clarification.

## 9. Compliance and Training

All employees involved in claims handling and underwriting must complete annual fraud awareness training. This training will cover current fraud trends, ethical obligations, reporting procedures, and legal requirements. Failure to report suspected fraud may result in disciplinary action in accordance with the Employee Conduct Policy.

## 10. Legal and Regulatory Obligations

`[Your Company Name]` is committed to complying with all federal and state anti-fraud statutes, including but not limited to `[mention specific state statutes if applicable, e.g., California Insurance Code § 1871.4, New York Insurance Law § 403]`. The SIU is responsible for coordinating with law enforcement agencies and regulatory bodies as required by law. This includes filing mandatory reports (e.g., Fraud Referral Form, state-specific reports) to appropriate authorities when sufficient evidence of fraud exists.
