# Claims Dispute Resolution Policy

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This Claims Dispute Resolution Policy outlines the procedures and principles for fairly and efficiently resolving disputes that may arise concerning claims submitted to [Company Name]. The purpose of this policy is to ensure transparency, consistency, and customer satisfaction in all claim-related decisions, while adhering to regulatory requirements and internal guidelines. It provides claimants with clear avenues to challenge claim determinations and ensures that all disputes are reviewed by impartial parties.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all claims submitted to [Company Name] and all subsequent decisions made regarding those claims, including but not limited to denials, partial approvals, and benefit amount determinations. It covers disputes initiated by policyholders, beneficiaries, or their authorized representatives. This policy applies to all internal departments involved in claim processing and dispute resolution.

### 2.1. Inclusions
*   Disputes related to claim eligibility.
*   Disputes related to the amount of benefit paid or payable.
*   Disputes regarding the interpretation of policy terms and conditions as they apply to a claim.
*   Procedural disputes related to claim handling.

### 2.2. Exclusions
*   General inquiries or requests for clarification that do not challenge a claim decision.
*   Claims that are still pending an initial decision, unless the dispute is specifically about a delay exceeding published service level agreements.
*   Disputes pertaining to administrative matters outside of specific claim decisions (e.g., premium billing which is covered under a separate policy).
*   Fraudulent claims, which are handled under the Fraud Detection and Prevention Policy.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Claimant:** The individual or entity submitting a claim for benefits under a policy with [Company Name].
*   **Claim Decision:** The formal determination by [Company Name] regarding a submitted claim, including approval, denial, or modification of benefits.
*   **Dispute:** A formal disagreement expressed by a Claimant regarding a Claim Decision.
*   **Appeal:** A formal request by a Claimant for reconsideration of a Claim Decision through an internal review process.
*   **Mediation:** A voluntary process where a neutral third party assists the disputing parties in reaching a mutually acceptable resolution.
*   **Arbitration:** A formal process where a neutral third party hears both sides of a dispute and makes a binding decision. (Note: Arbitration is not typically part of the initial internal dispute resolution but may be an external option outlined in specific policy contracts.)
*   **Dispute Resolution Officer (DRO):** A designated senior claims expert or legal professional within [Company Name] responsible for reviewing escalated appeals.

## 4. Claims Dispute Process

The dispute resolution process is structured in escalating stages to ensure thorough review and fair consideration of each case.

### 4.1. Stage 1: Initial Dispute/Informal Review

Upon receipt of a Claim Decision, if a Claimant wishes to dispute it, they should first contact the Claims Department within **30 calendar days** of receiving the initial decision.

#### 4.1.1. Procedure
1.  Claimant contacts the claims agent or department that issued the initial decision.
2.  Claimant clearly states the basis for their disagreement and provides any new or additional information they believe supports their position.
3.  The claims agent will review the additional information, re-evaluate the claim decision, and, if appropriate, consult with their supervisor.
4.  A response to this informal review will be provided within **10 business days**. This response will either uphold the original decision with further explanation, or adjust the claim decision.

### 4.2. Stage 2: Formal Internal Appeal

If the Claimant remains dissatisfied after the informal review (Stage 1), they may initiate a formal internal appeal.

#### 4.2.1. Requirements
*   The appeal must be submitted in writing (via mail or dedicated online portal) within **60 calendar days** of receiving the Stage 1 informal review decision.
*   The appeal must clearly state the grounds for disagreement, reference the claim number, and include any additional relevant documentation not previously submitted.
*   The Appeal Request Form (Form DR-001) must be completed and submitted.

#### 4.2.2. Procedure
1.  Upon receipt of a formal appeal, it is assigned to a designated Appeals Specialist, who was not involved in the original claim decision or Stage 1 review.
2.  The Appeals Specialist conducts a comprehensive review of the entire claim file, including all submitted documentation, policy terms, and relevant company guidelines.
3.  The Appeals Specialist may contact the Claimant for further clarification or request additional documentation if necessary.
4.  A written appeal decision will be issued within **30 calendar days** of receiving all necessary information. If additional time is required (e.g., for medical review), the Claimant will be notified, and the extension will not exceed **15 additional calendar days**.
5.  The appeal decision will provide a detailed explanation of the findings, the rationale behind the decision, and cite relevant policy provisions. It will also inform the Claimant of further options if they remain dissatisfied (Stage 3).

### 4.3. Stage 3: Executive Review (Optional, for complex or high-value cases)

For appeals pertaining to claims exceeding a payout value of \$100,000, or cases involving significant legal or medical complexities, claimants may request an Executive Review after an unfavorable Stage 2 decision.

#### 4.3.1. Requirements
*   Request for Executive Review must be submitted in writing within **30 calendar days** of the Stage 2 appeal decision.
*   The request should highlight specific points of disagreement with the Stage 2 decision and explain why an Executive Review is warranted based on complexity or financial impact.

#### 4.3.2. Procedure
1.  The request is reviewed by the Head of Claims or a Dispute Resolution Officer (DRO).
2.  The DRO will undertake a final internal review, consulting with relevant departmental heads or external experts as needed.
3.  A final written decision from the DRO will be provided within **60 calendar days**. This decision is binding for internal purposes and represents the highest level of internal review.

## 5. External Resolution Options

If a Claimant remains dissatisfied after exhausting all internal appeal processes, they may be entitled to pursue external resolution options.

### 5.1. Regulatory Bodies
Claimants may file a complaint with their provincial or state insurance regulatory authority. [Company Name] will cooperate fully with all investigations initiated by these bodies.

### 5.2. Mediation
In certain circumstances, and subject to mutual agreement, [Company Name] may offer or agree to participate in voluntary mediation with an independent third-party mediator. Costs for mediation will be shared equally unless otherwise agreed.

### 5.3. Legal Action
Claimants retain the right to pursue legal action as outlined in their policy contract and applicable laws, following the exhaustion of internal dispute resolution mechanisms. This policy is not intended to limit any legal rights available to the Claimant.

## 6. Exceptions

Any deviation from this policy requires documented approval from the Head of Claims and the Legal Department. Exceptions are typically granted only in extraordinary circumstances, such as:

*   Demonstrable new evidence requiring immediate review outside standard timelines.
*   Court orders or regulatory body directives.
*   Cases presenting significant precedents for the company that necessitate expedited high-level attention.

## 7. Evidence and Documentation

Claimants are responsible for providing all necessary documentation to support their claim and subsequent dispute. [Company Name] will clearly communicate what documentation is required at each stage.
Required documentation for a formal appeal (Stage 2) typically includes:
*   Completed Appeal Request Form (DR-001).
*   Copy of the original Claim Decision letter.
*   Copy of the Stage 1 informal review decision (if applicable).
*   Any new medical reports, invoices, or other evidence pertinent to the dispute.
*   A written statement detailing the specific reasons for the appeal and desired outcome.

## 8. Timelines

*   **Initial Dispute Contact:** Within 30 calendar days of Claim Decision.
*   **Informal Review Response:** Within 10 business days of contact.
*   **Formal Appeal Submission:** Within 60 calendar days of informal review decision.
*   **Formal Appeal Decision:** Within 30 calendar days (or up to 45 with notification) of receiving all required information.
*   **Executive Review Submission (if applicable):** Within 30 calendar days of formal appeal decision.
*   **Executive Review Decision (if applicable):** Within 45 calendar days.

All timelines are strictly adhered to, and claimants will be notified in writing if any extensions are necessary, along with the reason for the delay.

## 9. Record Keeping

All claims dispute documentation, including correspondence, evidence, decisions, and appeal outcomes, will be retained in the Claimant's file for a minimum of seven (7) years after the final resolution date, in accordance with regulatory requirements and [Company Name]'s data retention policy.
