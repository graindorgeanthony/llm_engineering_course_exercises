Claim Intake and Triage Policy
Document ID: CP-101
Effective Date: 2024-01-01
Version: 1.0

Purpose
Establish a standardized process for receiving, logging, and triaging insurance claims to ensure timely handling and consistent customer experience.

Scope
All lines of business and all claim intake channels, including phone, web portal, email, and agent submissions.

Policy
1. CP-101-P1: Claims must be logged in the claims management system within 2 hours of receipt.
2. CP-101-P2: Intake agents must capture required minimum data:
   - Policy number, claimant contact information, date of loss, loss location, and loss description.
3. CP-101-P3: Triage must classify each claim by severity, complexity, and potential fraud indicators.
4. CP-101-P4: High-severity claims (estimated loss > 25,000 USD or injury present) must be assigned to a senior adjuster within 4 hours.
5. CP-101-P5: Claims missing required data must be flagged for immediate follow-up; follow-up attempts must be made within 1 business day.

Roles and Responsibilities
- Intake Agent: Record claim, validate required fields, initiate triage.
- Triage Lead: Review classification and assign adjuster.
- Claims Supervisor: Monitor compliance and staffing.

Decision Criteria
- CP-101-DC1: IF required minimum data is missing THEN flag claim for follow-up and do not advance to full handling until completed.
- CP-101-DC2: IF estimated loss > 25,000 USD OR injury present THEN classify as high-severity and assign to senior adjuster within 4 hours.
- CP-101-DC3: IF potential fraud indicators are present THEN escalate per fraud referral policy after triage classification.

Records and Retention
All intake records, call recordings, and triage notes must be retained for 7 years.
