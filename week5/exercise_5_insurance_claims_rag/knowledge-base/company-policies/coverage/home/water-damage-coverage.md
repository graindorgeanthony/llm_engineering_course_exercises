# Water Damage Coverage Policy

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This policy outlines the terms, conditions, and limitations for water damage coverage under our standard Homeowner's Insurance policies (HO-3, HO-5, and HO-8). The purpose of this document is to clearly define what types of water damage are covered, what is excluded, and the specific requirements for filing a claim to ensure transparency and efficient claims processing. This policy aims to minimize ambiguity regarding water-related losses to residential properties.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all policyholders with active Homeowner's Insurance policies (HO-3, HO-5, HO-8, and equivalent packages) that include property damage coverage for their primary residence and accompanying structures.

### 2.1 Included
*   Damage to dwelling and other structures.
*   Damage to personal property (contents).
*   Additional living expenses (ALE) if the dwelling becomes uninhabitable due to a covered water damage event.

### 2.2 Excluded
*   Properties not covered by an active homeowner's policy.
*   Commercial properties.
*   Mobile homes (unless specifically endorsed).
*   Vacant properties (as defined in policy agreement, typically after 30 days of vacancy) without a specific vacancy endorsement.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Sudden & Accidental:** An event that is unforeseen, unintended, and occurs abruptly, not over a period of time.
*   **Gradual Leak:** Water damage resulting from continuous or repeated seepage or leakage over weeks, months, or years, often due to poor maintenance or neglected repairs.
*   **Sump Pump:** A pump used to remove water that has accumulated in a water-collecting sump basin, typically found in the basement of homes.
*   **Sewer Backup:** The overflow or discharge of sewer water, often from municipal sewer lines, into a property through drains, toilets, or other plumbing fixtures.
*   **Flood:** The inundation of two or more acres of land that is usually dry, or of two or more properties (at least one of which is the policyholder's property) by water or mudflow. This typically originates from overflowing rivers, tidal waters, or heavy rainfall. *Note: Most standard policies exclude flood and require a separate flood insurance policy.*

## 4. Covered Perils and Conditions

This section details the specific types of water damage incidents generally covered under standard homeowner's policies, subject to deductibles and policy limits.

### 4.1 Sudden & Accidental Discharge or Overflow

Coverage is provided for direct physical loss to covered property caused by sudden and accidental discharge or overflow of water or steam from:
*   **Plumbing systems:** Including pipes, drains, appliances (e.g., washing machine hoses, dishwashers, water heaters).
*   **Heating systems:** Boilers, radiators, central heating units.
*   **Air conditioning systems:** Condensate lines, refrigerant lines.
*   **Automatic fire protective sprinkler systems.**
*   **Household appliances:** Such as refrigerators with ice makers, washing machines, or dishwashers.

**Requirements:**
*   Damage must be **sudden and accidental**, not gradual.
*   The source of the discharge or overflow must be within the dwelling or directly connected to its systems.
*   Policyholders must take reasonable steps to prevent further damage once the incident is discovered (e.g., turning off main water supply).

**Examples:**
*   A pipe bursts in an attic due to freezing temperatures, causing ceiling damage.
*   A washing machine hose suddenly disconnects, flooding a laundry room.
*   A water heater ruptures, leading to water damage in the basement.

### 4.2 Freezing of Plumbing Systems

Coverage is provided for loss to the plumbing, heating, or air conditioning systems, or to household appliances, caused by freezing.

**Requirements:**
*   The policyholder must have used reasonable care to maintain heat in the building; OR
*   The policyholder must have shut off the water supply and drained all systems and appliances.
*   If the dwelling was vacant at the time of loss, reasonable care (as defined above) must still have been exercised.

**Exceptions:** Coverage may be denied if the dwelling was vacant or unoccupied and the policyholder failed to meet the above requirements.

### 4.3 Sewer Backup and Sump Pump Overflow

Standard homeowner's policies typically *exclude* water damage caused by sewer backup or sump pump overflow. However, coverage can often be added via an **endorsement**.

**Requirements for Endorsed Coverage:**
*   A specific "Sewer Backup and Sump Pump Overflow" endorsement must be added to the policy.
*   The endorsement will specify a separate sub-limit of liability for such damages (e.g., $10,000, $20,000).
*   Damage must be a direct result of backup through sewers or drains, or overflow/discharge from a sump pump, sump pump well, or similar system.

**Decision Logic:** If a claim involves sewer backup or sump pump overflow, verify the presence and limits of the specific endorsement. If no endorsement is present, the claim for these specific perils will be denied.

## 5. General Exclusions (Not Covered)

The following types of water damage are generally *not* covered under standard homeowner's policies, regardless of cause:

*   **Flood:** Damage from rising water, tidal waves, storm surges, or surface water that enters the home from the outside (e.g., overflowing rivers, heavy rain overwhelming drainage). Requires separate Flood Insurance (e.g., NFIP).
*   **Gradual Leaks/Seepage:** Damage resulting from continuous or repeated seepage or leakage of water over a period of weeks, months, or years from any plumbing system or appliance. This includes damage from chronic roof leaks, groundwater seepage through foundation walls, or persistent leaking faucets.
    *   **Decision Logic:** If water damage is determined to be the result of a long-term, unaddressed issue rather than a sudden event, it will be excluded. Evidence includes widespread mold, extensive rot, or discoloration indicating prolonged moisture.
*   **Water from the Ground:** Damage caused by water that seeps or leaks through foundations, basements, or other ground-level structures, including hydrostatic pressure, or springs.
*   **Neglect:** Damage that results from the policyholder's failure to take reasonable means to save and preserve the property at and after the time of loss. This includes not mitigating initial damage (e.g., not turning off the water supply after a burst pipe).
*   **Maintenance Issues:** Damage caused by wear and tear, deterioration, rust, corrosion, or lack of maintenance of plumbing or appliance systems.
*   **Governmental Action:** Water damage caused by ordinance or law, or earth movement (e.g., landslide, earthquake) even if water is involved.
*   **Intentional Acts:** Deliberate acts by the policyholder causing damage.
*   **Faulty Construction/Defective Materials:** Water damage directly resulting from inherent defects in construction, design, or materials, unless the resulting damage from a *covered peril* (e.g., a sudden pipe burst caused by faulty plumbing installation) is specifically covered. The cost to repair the faulty construction itself is excluded.

## 6. Filing a Water Damage Claim

### 6.1 Steps for Policyholders
1.  **Safety First:** Ensure personal safety and, if safe to do so, turn off the main water supply to prevent further damage.
2.  **Mitigate Damage:** Take reasonable steps to protect property from further damage (e.g., remove standing water, move undamaged items to a dry area, ventilate). Do not make permanent repairs before inspection.
3.  **Document the Damage:** Take photographs and videos of the damage, including the source if identifiable.
4.  **Contact Claims Department:** Report the loss immediately to [Insurance Company Name] Claims Department at 1-800-XXX-XXXX or via the online portal.
5.  **Provide Information:** Be prepared to provide policy number, date of loss, description of the incident, and extent of damage.
6.  **Do Not Dispose:** Do not dispose of damaged property until instructed by the claims adjuster.

### 6.2 Evidence/Documentation Required for Processing
*   Completed Claims Form.
*   Photos and/or videos of the damaged property and presumed source of water.
*   Receipts for any temporary repairs or mitigation efforts (e.g., water extraction, professional drying services).
*   Documentation of professional estimates for repairs to the dwelling and personal property.
*   Proof of ownership/value for damaged personal property (e.g., original receipts, bank statements, photos).
*   If applicable, receipts for additional living expenses incurred due to displacement.

## 7. Timelines

*   **Reporting:** Claims should be reported as soon as reasonably possible following the discovery of damage, ideally within 24-72 hours for prompt assessment.
*   **Initial Contact:** An adjuster will attempt to contact the policyholder within 24-48 business hours after the claim is filed.
*   **Inspection:** On-site inspection will be scheduled within 3-5 business days of adjuster contact, depending on adjuster availability and loss severity.
*   **Claim Decision:** A final decision on coverage and settlement offer will typically be provided within 30-45 calendar days after all required documentation is received, although complex claims may take longer.

## 8. Exceptions

*   **Emergency Services:** In cases of severe water damage posing an immediate health hazard or structural risk, policyholders may be advised to engage emergency mitigation services (e.g., water extraction, mold remediation) provided they document the process and expenses thoroughly for review. Prior authorization is recommended.
*   **Unique Policy Endorsements:** Individual policies may have specific endorsements that override or modify certain general policy exclusions (e.g., guaranteed replacement cost, extended coverage for specific perils). All claims will be reviewed against the specific declarations and endorsements present in the policyholder's current policy package.

## 9. Decision Logic for Adjusters

When evaluating a water damage claim, adjusters must follow this core logic:

1.  **Verify Policy Coverage:** Confirm an active homeowner's policy was in force at the Date of Loss.
2.  **Identify Cause of Loss:** Determine the direct cause of the water damage (e.g., burst pipe, appliance leak, sewer backup, flood).
    *   *If cause is flood:* Deny under standard policy; advise on NFIP if applicable.
    *   *If cause is gradual leak/seepage:* Deny due to exclusion.
    *   *If cause is sudden/accidental internal source (e.g., burst pipe):* Proceed.
    *   *If cause is sewer backup/sump pump overflow:* Check for specific endorsement. If present, proceed subject to endorsement limits. If not present, deny this specific peril.
3.  **Assess Damage Type:** Evaluate dwelling, other structures, and personal property damage.
4.  **Confirm Eligibility Criteria Met:** For covered perils, ensure conditions like "sudden and accidental" are met, and no exclusions (e.g., neglect, vacancy without heat) apply.
5.  **Review Mitigation Efforts:** Policyholder's actions to prevent further damage are considered. Failure to mitigate may result in reduced payout for avoidable damage.
6.  **Calculate Loss:** Determine repair costs, replacement costs for contents, and applicable ALE, applying depreciation as per policy terms.
7.  **Apply Deductible & Limits:** Subtract the policy deductible (typically $1,000 or $2,500) and ensure total payout does not exceed policy limits for dwelling, contents, and ALE.

This structured approach ensures consistent and fair claim processing in accordance with policy terms.
