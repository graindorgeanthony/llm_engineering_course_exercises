# Fire Damage Coverage Policy

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This policy outlines the terms, conditions, and scope of fire damage coverage provided under standard homeowner's insurance policies (Policy Series HO-3 and HO-5). The purpose of this document is to clearly define what constitutes covered fire damage, enumerate specific exclusions, detail the claims process, and clarify the insurer's obligations and the policyholder's responsibilities in the event of a fire-related loss. This ensures consistent application of coverage and efficient claims processing for residential properties.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all active homeowner insurance policies issued by [Your Company Name] under product lines HO-3 (Special Form) and HO-5 (Comprehensive Form) for properties located within the United States. It specifically covers direct physical loss or damage to insured dwelling structures, other structures, and personal property caused by fire or lightning.

### 2.1 Included
*   Direct damage to the dwelling and other structures (e.g., detached garages, sheds) from fire.
*   Damage to personal property stored within the dwelling or other structures.
*   Smoke damage resulting directly from a covered fire.
*   Water damage caused by firefighting efforts.
*   Damage caused by collapse resulting from a covered fire.
*   Increased Living Expenses (ALE) incurred due to the dwelling being uninhabitable because of a covered fire, up to policy limits.
*   Debris removal costs for property damaged by a covered fire.

### 2.2 Excluded
*   Damage resulting from arson committed by an insured party.
*   Damage from war, nuclear hazard, or government action.
*   Damage from earth movement (e.g., earthquake, landslide) unless fire ensues, and then only for the ensuing fire damage.
*   Damage from flood unless fire ensues, and then only for the ensuing fire damage.
*   Damage caused by fire that occurs during a period where the dwelling has been vacant for more than 30 consecutive days prior to the loss, unless specifically endorsed otherwise.
*   Damage to personal property specifically excluded by the main policy (e.g., certain types of motor vehicles, data, valuable papers).
*   Damage from agricultural or industrial burning controlled by the policyholder that is unauthorized or violates local ordinances.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Insured Property:** The dwelling, other structures, and personal property covered under the policy.
*   **Fire:** Combustion or burning in which property is actively destroyed. This includes friendly fires (e.g., fire contained in a fireplace) that escape their intended confines and cause damage.
*   **Lightning:** A natural electrical discharge originating in the atmosphere.
*   **Smoke Damage:** Damage to property caused by the visible products of combustion from a fire.
*   **Increased Living Expenses (ALE):** Necessary and reasonable expenses incurred by the insured for an alternative place to live and additional costs for food, transportation, etc., when the insured dwelling is uninhabitable due to a covered loss.
*   **Vacant:** A dwelling is considered vacant when it is both unfurnished and unoccupied for an extended period, typically 60 days, as defined in the master policy.
*   **Unoccupied:** A dwelling is considered unoccupied when it contains furnishings but no one is living there. Unoccupancy generally does not trigger the same exclusions as vacancy for fire damage unless specified.

## 4. Coverage Details

### 4.1 Dwelling and Other Structures Coverage
Fire damage to the primary dwelling structure and all other structures on the insured premises (e.g., sheds, detached garages) is covered up to the stated "Dwelling Coverage" amount (Coverage A) and "Other Structures" amount (Coverage B) on the policy declarations page. Coverage is typically provided on a Replacement Cost Value (RCV) basis, meaning the cost to repair or replace the damaged property with materials of like kind and quality, without deduction for depreciation, subject to the policy limits. If the damaged property is not repaired or replaced, payment will be on an Actual Cash Value (ACV) basis.

### 4.2 Personal Property Coverage
Damage to personal property (Coverage C) due to fire is covered up to the stated percentage of the Dwelling Coverage (typically 50% or 70%) or a specific limit shown on the declarations page. Personal property coverage is generally provided on an Actual Cash Value (ACV) basis unless an endorsement for Replacement Cost Value (RCV) for Personal Property is purchased. Special limits apply to certain categories of personal property, such as jewelry, firearms, and furs, as detailed in the master policy document.

### 4.3 Loss of Use / Additional Living Expenses (ALE)
If a covered fire makes the insured dwelling uninhabitable, the policy will pay for increased living expenses (Coverage D) incurred by the insured for the shortest time required to repair or replace the damage, or if the insured permanently relocates, for the shortest time required for the household to settle elsewhere, up to the policy limit, typically 20% of Coverage A.

### 4.4 Debris Removal
The policy covers reasonable expenses to remove debris of damaged property, up to the limits of the applicable coverage (Dwelling, Other Structures, Personal Property). An additional 5% of the applicable limit may be available if debris removal costs exhaust the coverage limit.

## 5. Claims Process for Fire Damage

Upon discovery of fire damage, policyholders must adhere to the following steps:

1.  **Immediate Notification:** Report the loss to [Your Company Name] within 72 hours of discovery via the claims hotline (1-800-XXX-XXXX) or online claims portal.
2.  **Ensure Safety:** Prioritize personal safety and, if safe to do so, prevent further damage (e.g., turning off utilities, securing premises). Do not re-enter a fire-damaged structure without clearance from fire authorities.
3.  **Contact Emergency Services:** If not already done, ensure fire department and local law enforcement (if suspicion of arson) have been contacted. Obtain incident reports.
4.  **Documentation:** As soon as it is safe, document the damage thoroughly with photographs and videos. Create an inventory of damaged personal property, including descriptions, estimated age, purchase price, and location.
5.  **Protection of Property:** Take reasonable steps to protect the property from further damage (e.g., temporary repairs to secure openings, drying out water-damaged areas). Keep receipts for all expenses incurred for emergency repairs.
6.  **Cooperation with Adjuster:** Cooperate fully with the assigned claims adjuster, providing access to the damaged property, documents, and answering all inquiries truthfully.
7.  **Proof of Loss:** Submit a signed and sworn Proof of Loss statement within 60 days of the company's request, detailing the origin, cause, and extent of the loss, as well as an inventory of damaged property.

### 5.1 Decision Logic for Coverage Approval
A claim for fire damage will be approved if all the following conditions are met:
*   The policy was active and in force at the time of the loss.
*   The damage is a direct result of fire or lightning.
*   The cause of the fire is not specifically excluded by the policy.
*   The policyholder has complied with all policy conditions, including notification and cooperation requirements.
*   The reported damages are substantiated by evidence and adjuster's assessment.

### 5.2 Evidence and Documentation Required
*   Official Fire Department Incident Report.
*   Photographs and videos of the damaged property and contents.
*   Detailed inventory of damaged personal property with supporting documentation (receipts, appraisals where available).
*   Estimates for repair or replacement from qualified contractors.
*   Receipts for ALE and emergency repairs.
*   Any police reports if arson is suspected.

## 6. Exceptions

*   **Subrogation:** If the fire damage is caused by a third party, [Your Company Name] reserves the right to pursue recovery from that party, and the policyholder is obligated to cooperate with such efforts.
*   **Partial Loss Repair:** For partial losses, payment will be made for the actual cost to repair or replace the damaged portion of the structure or property, not exceeding the policy limits.
*   **Total Loss Settlement:** In the event of a total fire loss, the dwelling will be settled up to the full Dwelling Coverage limit, subject to local building codes and ordinances.
*   **Building Code Upgrades:** Coverage may include costs to bring the repaired or rebuilt structure up to current building codes, if specifically included by endorsement or required by law and not otherwise excluded.

## 7. Timelines

*   **Claim Notification:** Within 72 hours of discovery.
*   **Adjuster Contact:** An adjuster will typically contact the policyholder within 24-48 business hours of claim notification.
*   **Proof of Loss Submission:** Within 60 days of the request from [Your Company Name].
*   **Claim Decision & Payment:** Once all required documentation is received and reviewed, [Your Company Name] commits to making a coverage decision and tendering payment within 30 business days, in accordance with state regulations. Complex claims may require additional time for investigation.
