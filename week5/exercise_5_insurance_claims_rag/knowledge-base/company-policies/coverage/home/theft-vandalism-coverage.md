# Theft and Vandalism Coverage Policy

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This policy outlines the terms, conditions, and limitations for theft and vandalism coverage under homeowner insurance policies issued by SentinelSure Insurance. The purpose of this document is to provide clear guidelines for assessing eligibility and processing claims related to loss or damage caused by theft, attempted theft, or vandalism to insured property. This ensures fair and consistent application of policy provisions and assists claims adjusters and policyholders in understanding their rights and responsibilities.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all standard homeowner's insurance policies (HO-3, HO-5, and HO-8 forms) issued by SentinelSure Insurance that include "Theft" and "Vandalism and Malicious Mischief" as covered perils. It covers direct physical loss or damage to insured dwelling, other structures, and personal property.

### 2.1 Inclusions:
*   Damage to the insured dwelling or other structures caused by burglars or vandals during an act of theft or malicious mischief.
*   Loss of personal property due to theft from the insured premises.
*   Loss of personal property due to theft from a vehicle, boat, or recreational vehicle while on the insured premises.
*   Damage sustained during an attempted burglary or act of vandalism.

### 2.2 Exclusions:
*   Theft of property from a dwelling under construction unless the dwelling is secured and inhabited or SentinelSure provides specific endorsement.
*   Theft or vandalism committed by an insured, any resident of the insured household, or their agents (see Section 6.1).
*   Mysterious disappearance or unexplained loss where theft cannot be reasonably inferred.
*   Losses specifically excluded by the policy's general exclusions (e.g., war, nuclear hazard, government action).
*   Damage due to wear and tear, deterioration, inherent vice, or latent defect.
*   Theft of property from a vehicle, boat, or recreational vehicle *not* on the insured premises, unless specifically covered by an endorsement (e.g., Personal Property Away From Premises endorsement).
*   Vandalism or malicious mischief if the dwelling has been vacant for more than 30 consecutive days immediately before the loss, as per the Vacancy Clause (see Section 6.2).
*   Loss of cash, precious metals, or securities beyond policy sub-limits (typically $200 for cash).
*   Loss of specific valuable articles (jewelry, furs, firearms, silverware) beyond policy sub-limits, unless scheduled on a Personal Articles Floater.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Theft:** Any act of stealing or taking property with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it, including larceny, burglary, and robbery.
*   **Vandalism:** The willful or malicious destruction or defacement of public or private property.
*   **Malicious Mischief:** Intentional damage to property. Often grouped with vandalism, it implies a deliberate act to harm or destroy property.
*   **Insured Premises:** The dwelling and other structures located at the mailing address shown in the Declarations, including the land on which these structures are located.
*   **Vacancy:** A dwelling is considered "vacant" when it is devoid of occupants and also lacks sufficient furnishings and personal property to support customary living. A dwelling is not vacant merely because its occupants are temporarily absent, regardless of the duration.
*   **Occupied:** A dwelling is considered occupied if there are residents living in it and it contains the necessary furnishings and personal property for typical living, even if the residents are temporarily away.

## 4. Main Content

### 4.1 Coverage Limits

The standard homeowner policy provides coverage for theft and vandalism up to the policy's stated limits for:

        *   Property away from the insured premises used for business purposes: **$1,500**.

### 4.2 Deductibles

All theft and vandalism claims are subject to the policy's stated deductible, which is applied per occurrence. The deductible amount is specified on the policy Declarations page (e.g., $1,000, $2,500).

## 5. Requirements and Criteria for Claim Submission

To process a theft or vandalism claim, the following criteria must be met and evidence provided:

### 5.1 Proof of Loss
*   **Police Report:** A copy of the official police report documenting the incident, including the date of loss, description of items stolen or damaged, and case number, is mandatory. The policyholder must report the incident to the police promptly after discovery.
*   **Evidence of Forced Entry/Vandalism:** For theft claims, evidence of forced entry (e.g., broken window, forced door lock) is often required, particularly if there are no witnesses. For vandalism, photographic or video evidence of damage is crucial.
*   **Itemized List of Damaged/Stolen Property:** Policyholders must provide a detailed list of all items claimed, including:
    *   Description of item (brand, model, serial number if applicable)
    *   Approximate date of purchase
    *   Original purchase price
    *   Location where item was stored
    *   Photographs of items (if available before loss) and damage (after loss)
    *   Receipts or other proof of ownership/value (e.g., appraisals for high-value items).
*   **Declarations Page:** A copy of the policy Declarations page confirming active coverage at the time of loss.

### 5.2 Timely Reporting
*   Claims must be reported to SentinelSure Insurance within **72 hours** of discovery of the loss, unless extenuating circumstances prevent timely reporting.
*   A "Proof of Loss" form must be submitted within **60 days** of SentinelSure's request.

## 6. Exceptions

### 6.1 Intentional Act by Insured
Loss or damage resulting from theft or vandalism committed by an insured (as defined in the policy), any resident of the insured household, or their agents is explicitly excluded. For example, if a policyholder's child intentionally damages the property, it is not covered.

### 6.2 Vacancy Clause
If the insured dwelling has been vacant for more than **30 consecutive days** immediately before the loss, coverage for vandalism, malicious mischief, and breakage of glass is suspended. In such cases, the claim will be denied unless specific vacancy/unoccupancy endorsements were purchased.
*   **Decision Logic for Vacancy:**
    1.  Determine the Date of Loss.
    2.  Ascertain the last date the dwelling was occupied (i.e., someone was living there and it contained furnishings for customary living).
    3.  If the period between the last occupancy date and the Date of Loss exceeds 30 consecutive days, the dwelling is considered vacant.
    4.  Verify if a Vacancy Permit or Unoccupancy Endorsement was active. If not, the claim for vandalism/malicious mischief/glass breakage is denied.

### 6.3 Mysterious Disappearance
Losses where property simply disappears without any evidence or reasonable inference of theft, destruction, or misplacement are generally not covered. There must be some observable facts or circumstances to suggest theft occurred (e.g., forced entry, witness accounts).

## 7. Examples

### 7.1 Covered Claim Example (Theft)
**Scenario:** Mr. and Mrs. Davis returned from a two-week vacation to find their back door forced open and their living room ransacked. Several electronics (TV, laptop) and jewelry items were missing. They immediately called the police, who filed a report, and then contacted SentinelSure. They provided photos of the forced entry, an itemized list with serial numbers and receipts for the stolen items, and a copy of the police report within 24 hours.
**Decision:** Claim is covered under theft peril. Damages to the back door will be covered under dwelling coverage, and stolen items under personal property coverage, subject to policy limits and deductible. The jewelry is subject to the $1,500 theft sub-limit unless a Personal Articles Floater was in place.

### 7.2 Covered Claim Example (Vandalism)
**Scenario:** During a weekend trip, a group of teenagers climbed onto the roof of Ms. Chen's detached garage and spray-painted graffiti across the entire structure. They also broke two windows of the garage. Ms. Chen discovered the damage on returning home, took photos, and reported it to the police.
**Decision:** Claim is covered under vandalism peril for damage to the garage structure and windows, subject to policy limits and deductible. Ms. Chen was away for only 3 days, so the vacancy clause does not apply.

### 7.3 Denied Claim Example (Vacancy Exclusion)
**Scenario:** Mr. Thompson inherited a house and decided to move out his belongings to renovate it for sale. The house sat empty with no utilities connected for 45 days. During this period, vandals broke in, smashed all windows, and spray-painted the interior walls. Mr. Thompson files a claim.
**Decision:** Claim denied for vandalism coverage. The dwelling was vacant for more than 30 consecutive days immediately preceding the loss, and no vacancy endorsement was purchased. Damage to windows resulting from vandalism is also excluded under this clause.

### 7.4 Denied Claim Example (No Evidence of Theft / Mysterious Disappearance)
**Scenario:** Ms. Lee reports that her diamond ring is missing from her jewelry box. She last saw it a month ago and cannot recall wearing it since. There is no sign of forced entry into her home, nor has anyone else been in her bedroom. She suspects it might have been stolen but has no evidence.
**Decision:** Claim denied. This falls under mysterious disappearance. Without any evidence of a burglary, forced entry, or other circumstances suggesting theft, the loss is not covered.

## 8. Evidence and Documentation

Policyholders are required to provide the following documentation to support a theft or vandalism claim:
*   Official police report with case number (mandatory).
*   Photographs or video evidence of the damaged property and/or scene of forced entry.
*   Itemized inventory of stolen or damaged property, including estimated age and condition.
*   Original receipts, appraisals, or credit card statements for high-value items, or items for which Actual Cash Value (ACV) or Replacement Cost (RCV) needs to be determined.
*   Any relevant security footage or witness statements.
*   Signed and sworn Proof of Loss form.

## 9. Timelines

*   **Reporting Loss to SentinelSure:** Within 72 hours of discovery.
*   **Submission of Police Report:** Within 7 days of filing the report, if not immediately available.
*   **Submission of Proof of Loss Form:** Within 60 days of SentinelSure's request for the form.
*   **Claim Investigation Period:** SentinelSure aims to complete investigations and make a coverage decision within 30 business days of receiving all required documentation. Complex cases may require longer.
*   **Payment of Covered Loss:** Within 15 business days of confirming coverage and agreeing on settlement terms.
