# Auto Liability Coverage Policy

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This policy document outlines the scope, limitations, and key provisions of our Auto Liability Coverage. The primary purpose of this coverage is to protect our policyholders from financial loss due to legal liability for bodily injury or property damage caused to third parties in an automobile accident for which the policyholder is determined to be at fault. This policy ensures compliance with state minimum financial responsibility laws and provides additional protection as selected by the policyholder.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all auto insurance policies issued by our company that include Liability Coverage for private passenger vehicles, motorcycles, and light commercial vehicles (under 10,000 lbs GVWR) registered in the United States and Canada.

### 2.1. Inclusions

*   Costs associated with bodily injury sustained by third parties.
*   Costs associated with property damage incurred by third parties.
*   Legal defense costs incurred by the policyholder with our consent, even if the policyholder is found not at fault.
*   Medical payments and funeral expenses for third parties within specified limits.
*   Coverage for damages caused by the policyholder or an authorized driver operating a covered vehicle.

### 2.2. Exclusions

*   Damage to the policyholder's own vehicle (covered under Collision or Comprehensive).
*   Bodily injury to the policyholder or named insureds (covered under Personal Injury Protection or Medical Payments).
*   Damage or injury intentionally caused by the policyholder.
*   Damage or injury occurring while the covered vehicle is being used for ridesharing or commercial purposes unless specifically endorsed.
*   Damage or injury occurring while the vehicle is being used in sanctioned racing or competitive events.
*   Incidents occurring outside of U.S. or Canadian territories.
*   Fines, penalties, or punitive damages where prohibited by state law.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Policyholder:** The individual or entity named in the policy declarations as the insured.
*   **Insured Vehicle:** Any vehicle specifically listed on the policy declarations page or a newly acquired vehicle that qualifies under the policy terms for temporary coverage.
*   **Third Party:** Any person or entity other than the policyholder or an immediate family member residing in the same household, who suffers bodily injury or property damage due to an incident involving the insured vehicle.
*   **Bodily Injury (BI):** Physical harm, sickness, disease, or death sustained by a person. Includes necessary medical, surgical, X-ray, dental services, prosthetic devices, and funeral expenses.
*   **Property Damage (PD):** Physical injury to, destruction of, or loss of use of tangible property.
*   **Policy Limits:** The maximum amount an insurer will pay for a covered loss, as stated in the policy declarations. Usually expressed as split limits (e.g., $100,000/$300,000/$50,000) or a combined single limit.

## 4. Coverage Details

### 4.1. Bodily Injury Liability Coverage

This coverage pays for damages for bodily injury or death resulting from an accident for which the policyholder is legally responsible. It includes, but is not limited to:

*   Medical expenses of the injured party.
*   Lost wages due to injury.
*   Pain and suffering.
*   Funeral expenses in case of death.

**Policy Limit Structure (Split Limits Example):**
For policies with split limits, the coverage is typically expressed as three numbers (e.g., $100,000/$300,000/$50,000):
*   First number ($100,000): Maximum payout for bodily injury to one person per accident.
*   Second number ($300,000): Maximum payout for bodily injury to all persons in one accident.
*   Third number ($50,000): Maximum payout for property damage per accident.

### 4.2. Property Damage Liability Coverage

This coverage pays for damages to the property of others resulting from an accident for which the policyholder is legally responsible. It includes, but is not limited to:

*   Repair or replacement of damaged vehicles.
*   Repair or replacement of damaged structures (e.g., fences, mailboxes, buildings).
*   Loss of use of damaged property.

**Policy Limit Structure:**
As part of the split limits, the third number represents the maximum payout for property damage per accident. For Combined Single Limit (CSL) policies, a single maximum amount applies to all bodily injury and property damage expenses per accident.

### 4.3. Legal Defense Costs

In the event of a covered bodily injury or property damage claim, we will provide and pay for legal defense for the policyholder. This includes attorney fees, court costs, and other related expenses, even if the suit is groundless, false, or fraudulent. These costs are typically paid in addition to the stated policy limits, unless otherwise specified in the declarations.

## 5. Requirements and Notification

To initiate a claim under this policy, the policyholder must:

1.  **Prompt Notification:** Notify the company as soon as practicable, but no later than 72 hours following an accident involving the insured vehicle that may result in a liability claim. Notification must be through the designated claims portal, hotline, or authorized agent.
2.  **Cooperation:** Cooperate fully with the company in the investigation, settlement, or defense of any claim or lawsuit. This includes providing all requested documentation, attending depositions, and appearing in court if required.
3.  **No Admission of Guilt:** Not voluntarily make any payment, assume any obligation, or incur any expense, other than for immediate medical aid to others at the time of the accident, without the company's written consent.
4.  **Forwarding of Legal Papers:** Immediately forward to the company every notice, summons, or other process received in connection with any accident or claim.

## 6. Claims Adjudication and Decision Logic

### 6.1. Fault Determination

Liability claims are processed based on the determination of legal fault. Our claims adjusters will investigate the accident by collecting evidence, including police reports, witness statements, photographs, and vehicle damage assessments. State-specific traffic laws and comparative negligence statutes will be applied to determine a percentage of fault, if applicable.

### 6.2. Coverage Application

Once fault is determined and the damages are assessed, the policy's bodily injury and property damage limits will be applied. Payments will not exceed the selected policy limits.

### 6.3. Settlement or Defense

*   **Settlement:** If a reasonable settlement can be reached within the policy limits, and the policyholder is deemed legally liable, the company will pursue settlement with the third party.
*   **Defense:** If a lawsuit is filed or if a settlement cannot be reached, the company will provide legal defense for the policyholder as per Section 4.3. The decision to defend or settle remains with the company, acting in the best interest of the policyholder and within the terms of the policy.

## 7. Exceptions

*   **Emergency Services:** Reasonable expenses for emergency first aid to others at the time of the accident are covered, irrespective of prior consent from the company, provided they relate to a covered incident.
*   **Non-Owned Vehicles:** Coverage may extend to the policyholder's liability when operating certain non-owned vehicles (e.g., rental cars, borrowed vehicles not regularly available for the policyholder's use), subject to specific policy endorsements and limitations. Refer to the "Use of Other Autos" section in the specific policy contract.
*   **Excess Coverage:** For certain high-value claims exceeding primary policy limits, an Umbrella Liability Policy may provide additional coverage, if purchased by the policyholder. This auto liability policy acts as primary coverage.

## 8. Evidence and Documentation

The following documentation is typically required for claim processing:

*   Completed claim form.
*   Police accident report (if applicable).
*   Photographs of the accident scene and vehicle damage.
*   Witness statements.
*   Estimates for property damage repair or replacement.
*   Medical records and bills for bodily injury claims.
*   Proof of lost wages (e.g., employer statements, pay stubs).
*   Any legal correspondence received.

## 9. Timelines

*   **Claim Reporting:** Within 72 hours of the accident (as per Section 5).
*   **Initial Contact with Adjuster:** Within 24-48 business hours of claim initiation.
*   **Investigation Completion:** Typically within 30 days for straightforward cases, but can extend depending on complexity, injury severity, or legal proceedings.
*   **Settlement Offer:** Within 10 business days of claim investigation completion and clear liability determination.
*   **Payment Issuance:** Within 5 business days of accepted settlement or court judgment.

These timelines are general guidelines and may vary based on the specifics of the claim and state regulations.
