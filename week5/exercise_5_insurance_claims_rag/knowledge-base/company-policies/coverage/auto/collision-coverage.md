# Collision Coverage Policy Details

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This document outlines the specifics of collision coverage provided under our standard auto insurance policies. Its purpose is to clearly define the protections offered, the responsibilities of the policyholder, and the procedures for filing and processing collision claims. This policy ensures consistency, fairness, and transparency in how collision-related damage claims are handled.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all active auto insurance policies that include collision coverage. It covers direct and accidental loss to a covered auto or its non-owned trailer resulting from its upset, or collision with another car or object.

### 2.1. Inclusions

*   Damage to your insured vehicle caused by a collision with another vehicle or object (e.g., tree, pole, guardrail).
*   Damage to your insured vehicle caused by an upset (e.g., rolling over).
*   Costs associated with towing and storage of the damaged vehicle to the nearest qualified repair facility or assessment center.
*   Costs for repair or replacement of damaged parts, up to the actual cash value (ACV) of the vehicle.

### 2.2. Exclusions

*   Damage to other vehicles or property (covered by Liability Coverage).
*   Damage due to other perils such as fire, theft, vandalism, falling objects, explosion, earthquake, windstorm, hail, water, flood, malicious mischief, riot or civil commotion, or contact with a bird or animal (covered by Comprehensive Coverage).
*   Mechanical breakdown, wear and tear, or freezing.
*   Loss to any electronic equipment that is not permanently installed in the auto.
*   Custom parts and equipment unless specifically endorsed and scheduled on the policy.
*   Damage incurred while the vehicle is being used for racing or speed contests.
*   Damage occurring while the vehicle is being driven by an uninsured driver not permitted by the policyholder.
*   Deductible amount, which is the policyholder's responsibility.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Actual Cash Value (ACV):** The cost to replace the damaged or stolen property, less depreciation.
*   **Deductible:** The amount of money the policyholder must pay out-of-pocket before the insurance company pays for a covered loss.
*   **Total Loss:** When the cost to repair a damaged vehicle exceeds a pre-defined percentage (typically 70-80%) of its Actual Cash Value, or when the damage is so severe that the vehicle cannot be safely repaired.
*   **Repair Facility:** An auto body shop or garage authorized and/or recommended by our claims department, or one chosen by the policyholder that meets our standards for repair quality.
*   **Covered Auto:** Any vehicle listed on the declaration page of the insurance policy for which collision coverage is purchased.

## 4. Deductible Application

The deductible amount specified on the policy declarations page will be applied to each separate collision claim. The policyholder is responsible for this amount, which will be subtracted from the total approved repair costs or the ACV in the event of a total loss.

### 4.1. Deductible Example

If a covered auto sustains $5,000 in collision damage and the policy has a $1,000 collision deductible, the insurance company will pay $4,000 to the repair facility or the policyholder, assuming all other criteria are met.

## 5. Repair Options and Procedures

### 5.1. Claim Notification

Policyholders must notify the company of a collision loss as soon as reasonably possible, typically within 72 hours of the incident. This can be done via phone, online portal, or mobile app.

### 5.2. Damage Assessment and Appraisal

1.  Upon notification, a claims adjuster will be assigned.
2.  The adjuster will arrange for an inspection of the damaged vehicle to assess the extent of the damage and determine the estimated cost of repairs. This may involve:
    *   On-site inspection by a staff adjuster.
    *   Submission of photos and repair estimates by the policyholder and/or repair facility.
    *   Inspection at a designated drive-in appraisal center.
3.  A detailed repair estimate will be generated, detailing parts, labor, and materials.

### 5.3. Repair Facility Selection

*   **Preferred Repair Network:** Policyholders are encouraged to use repair facilities within our Preferred Repair Network. These shops are vetted for quality, offer guaranteed repairs, and streamline the claims process.
*   **Policyholder's Choice:** Policyholders have the right to choose their own repair facility. However, our liability for repairs will not exceed the amount determined by our own appraisal process. If the chosen shop's estimate is higher, the policyholder may be responsible for the difference unless otherwise negotiated.

### 5.4. Authorization and Payment

1.  Once the repair estimate is approved by the policyholder and us, repairs can commence.
2.  We will issue payment for the covered damage, less the deductible. Payment may be issued directly to the repair facility or to the policyholder, depending on the arrangement and local regulations.
3.  Any supplementary damage discovered during repairs must be reported to the adjuster immediately for re-inspection and approval before additional work is performed.

## 6. Total Loss Procedures

### 6.1. Total Loss Determination Criteria

A vehicle is declared a total loss if the estimated cost of repairs, plus salvage value, exceeds 75% of the vehicle's Actual Cash Value (ACV) at the time of loss, unless otherwise mandated by state law.
*   The vehicle is deemed unsafe to repair by a qualified mechanic or state inspection.

### 6.2. Total Loss Settlement Process

1.  If the vehicle is declared a total loss, the claims adjuster will calculate the Actual Cash Value (ACV) of the vehicle based on market data for comparable vehicles in the regional area, considering factors such as age, mileage, condition, and optional equipment.
2.  The policyholder will be presented with an ACV offer.
3.  Upon acceptance of the offer and transfer of the vehicle's title to us (or our salvage vendor), payment will be issued for the ACV, less the applicable collision deductible and any outstanding premiums due.
4.  If the vehicle has a lien, the payment will first be used to satisfy the outstanding loan balance, with any remainder paid to the policyholder.
5.  Policyholders will be advised on how to dispose of the salvaged vehicle if they choose to retain it (e.g., acquiring a salvage title), but the settlement amount will be adjusted accordingly.

## 7. Evidence and Documentation Requirements

To facilitate the efficient processing of collision claims, policyholders must provide:

*   **Accident Report:** If filed with law enforcement (recommended for significant damage or injuries).
*   **Photos/Videos:** Of vehicle damage and incident scene, if available.
*   **Detailed Description:** Of how and when the collision occurred.
*   **Information of Other Parties:** Names, contact information, insurance details (if applicable).
*   **Repair Estimates:** From chosen repair facilities.
*   **Vehicle Title/Registration:** For total loss claims.
*   **Proof of Ownership and Lien Holder Information (if any):** For total loss claims.

## 8. Timelines

*   **Claim Notification:** Within 72 hours of incident (recommended).
*   **Initial Adjuster Contact:** Within 24-48 business hours of claim notification.
*   **Damage Appraisal:** Within 3-5 business days of adjuster contact or vehicle inspection.
*   **Repair Authorization:** Within 1-2 business days of estimate approval.
*   **Total Loss Settlement:** Within 7-14 business days of ACV agreement and title transfer.
*   **Final Payment for Repairs:** Issued promptly upon completion of repairs and receipt of final invoice, less deductible.
