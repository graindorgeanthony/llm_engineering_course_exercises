# Comprehensive Coverage Policy Details

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This document outlines the scope, definitions, criteria, and limitations of Comprehensive Coverage for automobile insurance policies issued by [Your Company Name]. The purpose of this policy is to provide financial protection to insureds against losses or damages to their insured vehicle that are not caused by a collision with another vehicle or object. It specifically addresses incidents arising from perils such other than collision.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all active automobile insurance policies that include Comprehensive Coverage as designated on the policy declarations page. It covers physical damage to the insured vehicle caused by non-collision incidents, subject to policy terms, conditions, exclusions, and deductibles.

### 2.1. Inclusions
*   Theft or attempted theft of the insured vehicle.
*   Vandalism or malicious mischief.
*   Fire.
*   Hail, wind, lightning, and other natural disasters (e.g., floods, earthquakes).
*   Falling objects (e.g., trees, rocks).
*   Explosion.
*   Riot or civil commotion.
*   Impact with animals (e.g., deer, birds).
*   Glass breakage (windshield, windows, sunroof).

### 2.2. Exclusions
*   Damage resulting from a collision with another vehicle or object (covered by Collision Coverage).
*   Normal wear and tear, mechanical breakdown, or inherent vice.
*   Damage from freezing unless accompanied by other covered perils.
*   Damage due to road hazards (e.g., potholes) not involving impact with an animal or falling object.
*   Confiscation by civil authorities.
*   Damage incurred while the vehicle is being used for racing or speed contests.
*   Intentional acts by the insured or parties acting on their behalf.
*   Theft of personal property from the vehicle (typically covered by homeowners/renters insurance).

## 3. Definitions

*   **Insured Vehicle:** The automobile specifically listed on the policy declarations page.
*   **Deductible:** The amount of damage that the insured is responsible for paying before the insurance company pays its portion.
*   **Actual Cash Value (ACV):** The fair market value of the vehicle immediately before the loss, considering depreciation.
*   **Total Loss:** When the cost to repair the damaged vehicle exceeds a specified percentage (e.g., 75-80%) of its Actual Cash Value, or when local regulations declare it a total loss.
*   **Peril:** A cause of loss such as fire, theft, or hail.

## 4. Coverage Details and Requirements

### 4.1. Claim Documentation Requirements
For all Comprehensive claims, the following documentation is generally required:
*   Completed Claim Form (Form AUTO-COMP-001).
*   Police report (mandatory for theft, vandalism, or any incident involving law enforcement). Report must include incident date, time, location, case number, and investigating agency.
*   Photographic evidence of damage (if applicable).
*   Estimates for repair from a licensed repair facility (at least one, two preferred for damages exceeding $2,500).
*   Proof of ownership (vehicle title or registration).

### 4.2. Theft Claims
*   **Reporting:** Must be reported to local law enforcement within 24 hours of discovery and to [Your Company Name] within 72 hours of discovery.
*   **Waiting Period:** A 30-day waiting period from the date of theft report to law enforcement will apply before a total loss settlement for theft can be made, to allow for recovery efforts.
*   **Settlement:** If not recovered within 30 days, the claim will be settled at the vehicle's Actual Cash Value, minus the applicable deductible.
*   **Recovery:** If the vehicle is recovered after settlement, the insured has the option to repurchase the vehicle from [Your Company Name] or turn over the title to the company.

### 4.3. Vandalism Claims
*   **Reporting:** A police report is required for any vandalism claim, detailing the nature of the damage and circumstances.
*   **Damage Assessment:** Damages will be assessed by an approved appraiser or repair facility to determine the extent of malicious damage versus normal wear or pre-existing conditions.

### 4.4. Natural Disaster Claims (Hail, Flood, Wind, Fire)
*   **Reporting:** Claims should be reported as soon as reasonably possible following the incident.
*   **Documentation:** Photos of the damage, along with any official weather reports or public warnings relevant to the incident date and location, are helpful but not always mandatory if damage is extensive and verifiable.
*   **Flood Damage:** Vehicles with flood damage where water enters the passenger compartment or engine will typically be declared a total loss if repair costs exceed 50% of ACV, due to potential long-term electrical and mechanical issues.

## 5. Deductibles

The deductible amount specified on the policy declarations page will be applied to each comprehensive claim. For example, if a policy has a $500 comprehensive deductible and the approved repair bill is $2,000, the payout will be $1,500.
*   **Glass Breakage:** Certain policies may include a separate, lower, or zero deductible for auto glass repair/replacement, explicitly stated on the declarations page. This typically applies to windshields and side windows. Full glass replacement may still be subject to standard comprehensive deductible if not specified.

## 6. Claims Process and Decision Logic

1.  **Claim Submission:** Insured or agent submits a claim via phone, online portal, or mobile app, providing initial details.
2.  **First Notice of Loss (FNOL):** Claim is assigned to an adjuster (within 24 hours for theft/major damage, 48 hours for others).
3.  **Investigation/Documentation:** Adjuster requests required documentation (police report, photos, estimates).
    *   *Decision Point:* If a police report is required (e.g., theft, vandalism) and not provided within 7 days, claim processing may be paused or denied.
4.  **Damage Assessment:** Adjuster reviews submitted estimates and may dispatch an appraiser or request an inspection at an approved repair shop.
    *   *Decision Point:* If repair costs exceed 80% of ACV (or lower for flood), the vehicle is typically declared a Total Loss.
5.  **Coverage Verification:** Adjuster verifies Comprehensive Coverage is active, deductible amount, and no exclusions apply.
    *   *Decision Point:* If the peril is excluded (e.g., collision), claim is denied under comprehensive.
6.  **Settlement Calculation:**
    *   **Repairable:** Approved repair cost minus deductible.
    *   **Total Loss:** ACV minus deductible, plus any applicable taxes and fees, usually paid directly to the lienholder first, then the insured.
7.  **Payment:** Payment issued to the insured, repair shop, or lienholder as appropriate.

## 7. Exceptions

*   **Emergency Repairs:** In urgent cases (e.g., undrivable vehicle, safety hazard), minor immediate repairs (e.g., towing, securing broken window) up to $250 may be approved by an adjuster without full documentation, pending further claim submission.
*   **Non-standard Vehicles:** Custom or modified vehicles may require special appraisal to determine ACV, potentially extending processing times.
*   **Multiple Perils:** If a single incident involves both collision and comprehensive perils (e.g., hitting an animal (comprehensive) and then swerving into a tree (collision)), separate deductibles may apply, or the claim may be processed under the predominant peril as determined by the adjuster. This decision criteria is based on the primary cause of the most significant damage.

## 8. Timelines

*   **Claim Acknowledgment:** Within 24-48 hours of FNOL.
*   **Initial Adjuster Contact:** Within 1-2 business days.
*   **Repair Estimate Review:** 3-5 business days after receipt of all estimates.
*   **Total Loss Settlement Offer:** 7-10 business days after all required documentation (including title for total loss) is received and ACV is determined.
*   **Claim Payout:** Within 2-5 business days after settlement agreement is reached and all necessary releases are signed.
*   **Theft Waiting Period:** 30 days before total loss settlement for theft.
