# Accidental Death Benefit Policy

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the terms and conditions for the Accidental Death Benefit (ADB) riders attached to eligible life insurance policies issued by [Company Name]. The ADB rider provides an additional benefit payment to the designated beneficiary(ies) if the Insured's death is a direct result of an accident, as defined herein, and occurs within a specified timeframe and under specific conditions. This policy ensures clarity in claims processing and consistent application of coverage criteria.

## 2. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to:
* Define what constitutes an "accidental death" for the purposes of the ADB rider.
* Specify the conditions under which the ADB will be payable.
* List situations and causes of death that are excluded from ADB coverage.
* Guide claims adjusters and beneficiaries on the required evidence for an ADB claim.
* Ensure fair and accurate processing of all ADB claims.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to all life insurance policies issued by [Company Name] that include an Accidental Death Benefit (ADB) rider. It covers claims submitted for deaths occurring on or after the effective date of this policy, irrespective of the life policy's issuance date.
This policy does *not* apply to:
* Basic life insurance death benefits, which are paid regardless of the cause of death (unless contested on other grounds).
* Disability benefits.
* Critical illness benefits.
* Any other riders not explicitly identified as Accidental Death Benefit riders.

## 4. Definitions

*   **Insured:** The person whose life is covered by the life insurance policy and the ADB rider.
*   **Beneficiary:** The individual(s) or entity designated by the policyholder to receive the benefit proceeds.
*   **Accidental Death:** Death resulting directly and independently of all other causes from bodily injury caused solely by external, violent, and accidental means, as further defined in Section 6.
*   **Accidental Means:** An event or circumstance that was unforeseen, unexpected, and unintended by the Insured. This refers to the means causing the injury, not merely the injury itself.
    *   *Example:* Drowning is an accidental death, where falling into water is the accidental means. Heart attack due to stress is not accidental means.
*   **Bodily Injury:** A physical injury to the body, traceable to a specific event or series of events, that is sudden, unexpected, and not caused by disease or bodily infirmity.
*   **Date of Accident:** The date on which the accidental means occurred, leading to the bodily injury.
*   **Date of Death:** The date on which the Insured officially passed away.

## 5. Accidental Death Benefit Coverage

The ADB rider provides a benefit amount, as specified in the policy declarations, which is typically equal to or a multiple of the basic life insurance coverage, upon the occurrence of an Accidental Death.

## 6. Criteria for Accidental Death

For a death to be classified as Accidental Death under this policy, all the following criteria must be met:

1.  **Direct and Sole Cause:** Death must result directly and independently of all other causes from bodily injury.
2.  **External, Violent, and Accidental Means:** The bodily injury must have been caused solely by external, violent, and accidental means.
3.  **No Pre-existing Conditions Contribution:** No disease, bodily or mental infirmity, medical treatment for such infirmity, or illness of any kind (whether known or unknown to the Insured) may have contributed to the death.
4.  **Time Limit:** Death must occur within **180 days** (six calendar months) from the Date of Accident.
5.  **Effective Coverage:** The ADB rider must be in force and all premiums paid up to the Date of Accident.
6.  **No Exclusions Apply:** The cause of death must not fall under any of the exclusions listed in Section 7 of this policy.

## 7. Exclusions

The Accidental Death Benefit is **not** payable if death results directly or indirectly from, or is caused or contributed to by, any of the following:

1.  **Disease or Illness:** Any form of illness, mental or physical disease, bodily or mental infirmity, or medical or surgical treatment for such, even if aggravated by an accident.
2.  **Suicide/Self-Inflicted Injury:** Suicide or any intentionally self-inflicted injury, while sane or insane.
3.  **War or Act of War:** War, declared or undeclared, or any act of war, insurrection, rebellion, or participation in a riot.
4.  **Aviation Activities (Non-Commercial):** Operating, riding in, or descending from any aircraft if the Insured is acting as a pilot, co-pilot, crew member, or is being trained for any of these roles; or engaging in any parachuting or skydiving activities. This exclusion does not apply if the Insured is a fare-paying passenger on a regularly scheduled commercial flight.
5.  **Hazardous Occupations/Activities:** Death occurring during the participation in inherently hazardous activities not disclosed and accepted by the Company, or professional sports activities that carry a significant risk of severe injury, unless expressly covered by endorsement.
6.  **Intoxication/Illegal Substances:** The Insured's use of drugs, including narcotics or intoxicants, unless administered on the advice of a physician. This includes operating a motor vehicle while legally impaired.
7.  **Commission of a Felony:** The Insured's commission or attempted commission of a felony.
8.  **Driving Under Influence (DUI):** Death resulting as a direct consequence of the Insured operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or any intoxicating substance in violation of local laws.
9.  **Poison, Gas, Fumes:** Inhaling any gas, poison, or fumes, voluntarily or involuntarily.
10. **Medical/Surgical Treatment:** Complications, infections, or unfavorable reactions arising from medical or surgical diagnostic or therapeutic procedures, unless directly necessitated by an accidental bodily injury for which benefit would otherwise be payable.

## 8. Evidence and Documentation Requirements

To process an Accidental Death Benefit claim, the following documentation and evidence are typically required:

1.  **Claim Form:** Completed Accidental Death Benefit Claim Form (Form ADV-ADB-001) provided by [Company Name].
2.  **Death Certificate:** Certified copy of the Insured's death certificate, clearly stating the cause and manner of death.
3.  **Police Report/Accident Report:** Official police report, accident reconstruction report, or any other official incident report from relevant authorities (e.g., fire department, workplace safety board) if the death involved an accident investigated by such authorities.
4.  **Coroner's Report/Autopsy Report:** A full copy of the Coroner's or Medical Examiner's report, including toxicology results, if an autopsy was performed. This is mandatory for all contentious causes of death or where impairment is suspected.
5.  **Medical Records:** All medical records pertaining to the injury and the treatment received from the Date of Accident until the Date of Death, including emergency room reports, hospital records, and physician's statements.
6.  **Beneficiary Identification:** Proof of identity for the beneficiary(ies).
7.  **Policy Documents:** Original policy document (if available) or policy number.

## 9. Decision Logic for Claim Approval

Claims for Accidental Death Benefit will be approved if, upon review of all submitted documentation:

*   The death meets all the criteria for Accidental Death as defined in Section 6.
*   The death is not attributable to any of the exclusions listed in Section 7.
*   All required documentation as per Section 8 has been provided and verified.
*   The rider was active and in force at the time of death.

**Approval Threshold:**
If the documentation conclusively demonstrates that the death was solely due to external, violent, and accidental means, and none of the exclusions apply, the claim will be approved.

**Referral for Investigation:**
If the documentation is ambiguous, incomplete, or suggests potential applicability of an exclusion, the claim will be referred to the Claims Investigation Unit for further review. This may involve:
*   Requesting additional records (e.g., further toxicology reports, witness statements).
*   Engaging independent medical examiners or accident reconstruction specialists.
*   Interviewing witnesses or involved parties.

## 10. Timelines

*   **Claim Submission:** Beneficiaries are encouraged to submit ADB claims as soon as reasonably possible after the Insured's death, typically within 90 days. However, failure to submit within this timeframe will not invalidate a claim if it was not reasonably possible to do so, provided it is submitted not later than one year from the time submission is otherwise required.
*   **Processing Time:** Once all required documentation is received, [Company Name] aims to process Accidental Death Benefit claims within **30 business days**. This timeline may be extended if further investigation is required.
*   **Benefit Payout:** Approved benefits will be disbursed to the designated beneficiary(ies) within 7 business days following claim approval.

## 11. Exceptions

Any request for an exception to this policy must be submitted in writing to the Senior Claims Adjudicator, outlining the specific circumstances and justification for the exception. Exceptions are granted only in rare and extraordinary circumstances and require approval from the Head of Claims and the Chief Underwriter. For example, if a medical condition was present but proven by a medical expert not to have contributed to the actual death, an exception might be considered.
