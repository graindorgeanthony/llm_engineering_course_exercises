## 5. Core Principles of Claims Processing

*   **Timeliness:** Claims must be processed and resolved within established internal SLAs and regulatory timelines.
*   **Accuracy:** All claim assessments, calculations, and decisions must be accurate and thoroughly documented.

*   **Compliance:** All activities must comply with internal policies, regulatory requirements (e.g., state insurance department regulations), and legal obligations.
*   **Customer Focus:** Claims agents must treat claimants with empathy and professionalism, aiming to provide clear explanations and support throughout the process.

## 6. Stages of Claims Processing

The claims processing lifecycle is generally divided into the following key stages:

### 6.1. Claim Intake and Validation (FNOL)
*   **Action:** Initial receipt of claim notification (phone, online portal, email, mail).
*   **Agent Responsibility:** Record FNOL details accurately, create a claim file in the Claims Management System (CMS), assign a unique claim number.
*   **Validation Criteria:** Verify policy existence and claimant's identity. Initial check for basic coverage eligibility.
*   **Timeline:** Acknowledge receipt of FNOL within 24 business hours.

### 6.2. Initial Review and Assignment
*   **Action:** Categorize the claim based on type, complexity, and severity.
*   **Agent Responsibility:** Assign the claim to an appropriate claims agent or adjuster specializing in that claim type/region.
*   **Decision Logic:** Simple claims may be fast-tracked; complex claims require assignment to senior adjusters.
*   **Timeline:** Claim assigned to a primary handler within 1 business day of FNOL completion.

### 6.3. Investigation and Assessment
*   **Action:** Gathering all necessary information and evidence.
*   **Agent Responsibility:**
    *   Contact claimant for additional documentation (e.g., police reports, medical records, invoices, photos).
    *   Interview relevant parties (witnesses, medical professionals, third parties).
    *   Conduct site visits, inspections, or engage expert assessors (e.g., adjusters, medical reviewers) as needed.
    *   Review policy terms and conditions thoroughly to determine coverage, deductibles, limits, and exclusions.
    *   Establish proximate cause of loss.
    *   Calculate potential loss and set appropriate reserves.
*   **Evidence/Documentation:** All communications, gathered documents, investigation reports, and expert opinions must be uploaded to the CMS.
*   **Decision Logic:** Based on collected evidence and policy language, determine if the loss is covered, partially covered, or excluded.

### 6.4. Decision Making and Benefit Determination
*   **Action:** Finalizing the claim decision and calculating the payout.
*   **Agent Responsibility:**
    *   Formulate a clear decision to approve, partially approve, or deny the claim.
    *   Calculate the final benefit amount in accordance with policy terms, legal obligations, and damage assessment.
    *   Prepare a clear, concise explanation of the decision, including justification for any denial or partial payment.
*   **Decision Logic:** Approval requires alignment with policy coverage, established proximate cause, and verifiable damages. Denial requires clear identification of policy exclusions or lack of coverage.
*   **Approval Authority:** Claims exceeding specific financial thresholds (e.g., $10,000 for auto, $50,000 for property) require manager approval. Claims over $100,000 require senior management approval.

### 6.5. Communication and Resolution
*   **Action:** Informing the claimant of the decision and initiating resolution.
*   **Agent Responsibility:**
    *   Communicate the claim decision to the claimant in writing (email or postal mail) within 2 business days of the decision being finalized.
    *   Clearly explain the reasons for the decision, especially in cases of denial or partial payment, referencing specific policy provisions.
    *   If approved, initiate payment processing.
    *   If denied, inform the claimant of their right to appeal and the relevant timelines and procedures.
*   **Timelines:** Payment initiated within 5 business days of claimant's acceptance of the settlement.

### 6.6. Payment or Denial
*   **Action:** Disbursing funds for approved claims or formally closing denied claims.
*   **Agent Responsibility:** Ensure payment accuracy and that funds are remitted via the agreed-upon method (e.g., electronic transfer, check). For denied claims, ensure all documentation is complete and the claim file is properly closed in the CMS.

## 7. Agent Responsibilities

Claims agents are responsible for:
*   Adhering strictly to this policy and all related SOPs.
*   Maintaining strict confidentiality of all claimant and policy information.
*   Consistently upholding ethical standards and avoiding conflicts of interest.

*   Seeking appropriate guidance from supervisors or legal counsel for complex or ambiguous cases.
*   Participating in ongoing training to stay updated on policy changes, regulations, and claims best practices.
*   Identifying and reporting potential fraud indicators to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU).

## 8. Exceptions

Any deviation from this policy must be documented and approved by a Claims Manager at Level 2 or higher, along with a clear justification. System-generated exceptions or alerts within the CMS must be reviewed and actioned promptly. Repeated exceptions or unauthorized deviations may result in disciplinary action.

## 9. Monitoring and Review

This policy will be reviewed annually by the Claims Leadership Team and Legal Department, or as necessitated by changes in regulations, business operations, or identified deficiencies. Any updates will be communicated to all relevant personnel and become effective on the specified review date. Performance metrics, including processing times, accuracy rates, and customer satisfaction scores, will be regularly monitored to ensure compliance and identify areas for improvement.
