# Policyholder Communication Preferences Policy

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This policy establishes the guidelines and mandatory procedures for recording, maintaining, and adhering to policyholder communication preferences throughout the claims lifecycle and general policy administration. The purpose is to ensure consistent, respectful, and legally compliant communication with all policyholders, enhancing customer satisfaction and operational efficiency, particularly within the Claims Department. Adhering to recorded preferences reduces communication errors, improves processing times, and reinforces trust.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who interact with policyholders on behalf of the company, specifically within the Claims, Underwriting, and Customer Service departments. It covers all forms of direct communication, including but not limited to email, postal mail, phone calls (voice and SMS), and secure online portals. This policy applies to all policy types (e.g., auto, home, life, commercial) and all stages of the customer lifecycle, from initial inquiry to policy renewal and claims settlement.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Policyholder:** The individual or entity named on an insurance policy as the insured party.
*   **Communication Channel:** The medium through which information is exchanged (e.g., email, phone, postal mail, SMS, secure portal).
*   **Communication Preference:** A policyholder's elected choice regarding the communication channels, frequency, and specific types of information they wish to receive.
*   **Primary Contact Method:** The policyholder's preferred and designated method for receiving critical or urgent communications.
*   **Secondary Contact Method:** Alternative contact methods designated by the policyholder for non-urgent or supplementary communications.
*   **Claims Lifecycle:** The entire process from claim initiation to resolution, including filing, investigation, settlement, and appeals.

## 4. Policy Statement

It is the company's policy to record and strictly adhere to the communication preferences expressed by policyholders. These preferences must be accurately captured in the designated Policy Administration System (PAS) or Claims Management System (CMS) and must be reviewed and honored for all subsequent communications, especially during the claims process. Any deviation from recorded preferences must be justified by urgent circumstances or legal requirements and documented accordingly.

## 5. Capturing and Recording Preferences

### 5.1 Initial Preference Capture
Communication preferences must be captured at the earliest point of interaction, typically during policy application, onboarding, or the first claim interaction.

### 5.2 Acceptable Methods for Preference Collection
*   Online policyholder portal (self-service)
*   Via phone call (recorded and agent-inputted)
*   Written correspondence (e.g., policy application forms, claim forms)
*   In-person interaction (agent-inputted)

### 5.3 Data Entry Standards
*   All preferences must be entered into the "Communication Preferences" module within the PAS/CMS.
*   Each preference entry must include:
    *   **Preference Type:** (e.g., Primary Contact, Marketing Opt-out, Claims Updates)
    *   **Channel:** (e.g., Email, Phone Call, SMS, Postal Mail, Secure Portal)
    *   **Contact Detail:** (e.g., `john.doe@example.com`, `(555) 123-4567`, `123 Main St`, secure portal username)
    *   **Effective Date:** Date the preference was set or last updated.
    *   **Source:** (e.g., "Online Portal", "Agent John Smith - 2023-10-25 Call", "Application Form")
    *   **Expiration Date (if applicable):** For temporary preferences.

### 5.4 Preference Hierarchy
Policyholders may specify a primary and secondary communication channel for different types of communications (e.g., email for routine updates, phone for urgent claim decisions). The system must allow for differentiation based on communication type.

## 6. Adhering to Preferences During Claims

### 6.1 Pre-Communication Check
Before initiating *any* direct communication with a policyholder regarding a claim, the assigned claims adjuster or staff member MUST consult the "Communication Preferences" section within the CMS.

### 6.2 Priority of Channels
*   **Primary Channel:** All critical claim updates (e.g., claim approval, denial, request for urgent documentation, settlement offers) must first be attempted via the policyholder's designated Primary Contact Method.
*   **Secondary Channel:** If the primary channel fails (e.g., email bounced, phone call unanswered after multiple attempts), or for non-urgent updates, secondary channels may be utilized as specified.
*   **General Information:** Routine claim acknowledgements, status updates, or requests for non-urgent information should primarily use the policyholder's preferred method for "General Correspondence" or "Claim Updates."

### 6.3 Examples of Channel Utilization
*   **Example 1: Primary Email:** Policyholder John Smith has `john.smith@email.com` as Primary Contact (Claims). Claims Adjuster Sarah Lee needs to send the initial claim acknowledgment. Sarah must email `john.smith@email.com`.
*   **Example 2: Primary Phone, Secondary Email:** Policyholder Jane Doe has `(555) 987-6543` as Primary Contact (Claims Updates) and `jane.doe@email.com` as Secondary. Adjuster Michael Chen needs to relay a high-priority update. Michael must first attempt to call Jane. If no answer after two attempts over 24 hours, Michael may then send an email, clearly stating "Follow-up to attempted phone calls."
*   **Example 3: Postal Mail Only:** Policyholder A. Corporation requests all claim correspondence be sent via postal mail to `P.O. Box 123, Anytown, USA 01234`. All claim documents and updates must be sent to this address, even if an email is on record for other purposes.

## 7. Updating and Modifying Preferences

### 7.1 Policyholder-Initiated Changes
Policyholders may update their preferences at any time through the following channels:
*   Secure online portal (changes are logged immediately).
*   Via phone call to Customer Service or Claims (agent must verify identity and log the updated preference and source in the PAS/CMS).
*   Written request (must be reviewed and entered by an authorized staff member within 2 business days of receipt).

### 7.2 Agent Responsibilities for Updates
When an agent receives a request to update preferences:
*   **Identity Verification:** The agent must verify the policyholder's identity using standard protocols (e.g., policy number, date of birth, last four digits of SSN, or other security questions).
*   **Accurate Recording:** Preferences must be updated in the "Communication Preferences" module of the PAS/CMS immediately.
*   **Confirmation:** Agents should confirm the updated preferences verbally or via a follow-up email/letter if requested.

## 8. Exceptions

### 8.1 Critical Communications
In cases of severe emergency or where there is a legal or regulatory requirement to provide immediate notification (e.g., certain types of fraud alerts, data breach notifications), the company may use alternative communication channels, even if they deviate from recorded preferences. Such deviations must be:
*   Documented clearly in the policyholder's record, including the reason for deviation.
*   Limited to the specific urgent communication.
*   Followed by an attempt to communicate via preferred channels if the urgent message is not confirmed received.

### 8.2 Legal and Regulatory Requirements
If a specific law or regulation mandates a particular communication channel (e.g., certified mail for certain legal notices), this will supersede policyholder preferences to ensure compliance. The specific legal requirement must be cited in the policyholder's records.

## 9. Evidence and Documentation

All communications, attempts at communication, and policyholder preference changes must be meticulously documented in the policyholder's record within the PAS/CMS. This includes:
*   Date and time of communication.
*   Channel used (e.g., email, phone, mail).
*   Summary of communication content.
*   Outcome (e.g., "email delivered," "voicemail left," "letter mailed," "call answered").
*   Agent ID.
*   Any issues encountered (e.g., bounced email, phone number disconnected).
*   For preference changes: Original preference, new preference, date of change, source of change, identity verification method.

## 10. Training and Compliance

All employees involved in policyholder communication will receive mandatory annual training on this policy. Adherence to this policy is subject to internal audits. Non-compliance may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.

## 11. Review and Revision

This policy will be reviewed annually, or as needed, to ensure its effectiveness, compliance with relevant laws and regulations, and alignment with company objectives. The effective date will be updated upon each revision.
