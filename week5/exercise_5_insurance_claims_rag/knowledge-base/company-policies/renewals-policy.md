## 1. Overview

This document outlines the guidelines and criteria used to assess the impact of past claims on a policyholder's eligibility for renewal and potential adjustments to policy premiums. The primary goal is to ensure fair, consistent, and data-driven decisions during the renewal process, balancing risk management with customer retention. This policy applies to all standard insurance products offered by Acme Insurance Co. (hereafter "the Company").

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all individual and small business policy renewals across property, casualty, and commercial lines of business. It covers the assessment of claims filed within the current policy term and preceding terms as defined by specific product guidelines.

### 2.1 Inclusions

*   Assessment of claim frequency and severity.
*   Determination of eligibility for standard renewal, non-renewal, or renewal under modified terms.
*   Calculation of claims-based premium surcharges or discounts.
*   Consideration of mitigation efforts by the policyholder following a claim.

### 2.2 Exclusions

*   Large commercial enterprise policies with bespoke underwriting agreements.
*   Policies underwritten by third-party carriers where renewal terms are dictated by partner contracts.
*   Claims that were denied and subsequently overturned on appeal if the overturned decision explicitly states no impact on future underwriting.
*   Claims designated as "Act of God" by the Claims Department (e.g., specific natural disaster events declared by authorities), unless frequency indicates systemic risk not mitigated by standard policy.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Claim Frequency:** The total number of reported claims within a specified look-back period (typically 3-5 years).
*   **Claim Severity:** The total financial payout associated with claims within a specified look-back period.
*   **Look-back Period:** The timeframe preceding the renewal date during which claims history is actively reviewed, typically 36 to 60 months, depending on product line.
*   **Loss Ratio:** The ratio of total claims paid out (plus adjustment expenses) to total premiums earned for a given policy or portfolio.
*   **Non-Renewal:** The Company's decision not to offer a new policy term upon the expiration of the current policy.
*   **Surcharge:** An additional charge added to the standard premium due to increased risk, often related to adverse claims history.
*   **Standard Renewal:** Offer of a new policy term under terms and conditions largely consistent with the expiring policy, subject to general market adjustments.

## 4. Renewal Eligibility Criteria Based on Claims Impact

Renewal decisions are primarily driven by the policyholder's historical loss experience relative to their premium.

### 4.1 Tiered Claims Impact Assessment

Insurance products are classified into tiers based on their inherent risk profile and average claim cost.

#### 4.1.1 Low Impact (Tier 1)

*   **Criteria:** Fewer than 2 claims within a 36-month look-back period, with a cumulative claim payout under $5,000 for personal lines or $15,000 for commercial lines. No single claim exceeding $3,000 for personal lines or $10,000 for commercial lines.
*   **Outcome:** Standard Renewal. No claims-based surcharge. Potential for Claims-Free Discount if applicable.

#### 4.1.2 Moderate Impact (Tier 2)

*   **Criteria:** 2-3 claims within a 36-month look-back period, or cumulative payouts between $5,000-$15,000 for personal lines ($15,000-$40,000 for commercial lines), or one single claim exceeding $3,000 but not $10,000 for personal lines ($10,000 but not $25,000 for commercial lines).
*   **Outcome:** Standard Renewal with potential for claims-based surcharge. Surcharge calculation detailed in Section 5. Underwriting review required for cumulative payouts exceeding $10,000 (personal) or $30,000 (commercial) to assess risk mitigation.

#### 4.1.3 High Impact (Tier 3)

*   **Criteria:** More than 3 claims within a 36-month look-back period, or cumulative payouts exceeding $15,000 for personal lines ($40,000 for commercial lines), or one single claim exceeding $10,000 for personal lines ($25,000 for commercial lines). Additionally, policies with an adverse Loss Ratio (greater than 1.25 over the last 3 policy years).
*   **Outcome:** Review for Modified Renewal Terms or Non-Renewal. Requires detailed Underwriting review.

### 4.2 Non-Renewal Triggers

Non-renewal will be considered under the following conditions:

*   **Excessive Claim Frequency:** 4 or more claims within a 36-month period, regardless of severity, indicating a systemic risk not aligned with Company underwriting appetite.
*   **Severe Single Claim:** A single claim exceeding $50,000 for personal lines or $150,000 for commercial lines, indicating catastrophic risk.
*   **Persistent High Loss Ratio:** Loss ratio consistently above 1.50 over two or more consecutive policy terms.
*   **Fraudulent Claims:** Any instance of a substantiated fraudulent claim.

## 5. Premium Adjustments (Surcharges/Discounts)

### 5.1 Claims-Based Surcharge Calculation

For policies categorized under Moderate Impact (Tier 2), a claims-based surcharge will be applied according to the following matrix:

| Claim Count (36 Months) | Cumulative Payout (Personal Lines) | Cumulative Payout (Commercial Lines) | Surcharge (%) |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :------------ |
| 1                       | $3,001 - $5,000                    | $10,001 - $15,000                    | 5%            |
| 2                       | Up to $5,000                       | Up to $15,000                        | 7.5%          |
| 2                       | $5,001 - $10,000                   | $15,001 - $30,000                    | 10%           |
| 3                       | Up to $10,000                      | Up to $30,000                        | 12.5%         |
| 3                       | $10,001 - $15,000                  | $30,001 - $40,000                    | 15%           |

*   Surcharges are cumulative for multiple criteria met but capped at 20%.
*   The surcharge is applied to the base premium before any other discounts (except multi-policy discounts).
*   Surcharges are typically applied for one renewal term (12 months) and are reviewed again upon subsequent renewal.

### 5.2 Claims-Free Discount Eligibility

Policyholders with no claims within the 36-month look-back period, or only minor incident reports (not resulting in a payout or policy indemnity), may be eligible for a Claims-Free Discount, typically 5-10% depending on the product line and duration of claims-free history (e.g., 3 years = 5%, 5+ years = 10%).

## 6. Exceptions and Special Considerations

### 6.1 Catastrophic Event Claims

Claims directly resulting from government-declared catastrophic events (e.g., hurricanes, widespread floods) will be individually reviewed. While they count towards frequency, their severity impact on premium adjustments may be mitigated, especially if the policyholder has taken Company-recommended prevention measures (e.g., storm shutters, flood barriers). Underwriting approval is required for such exceptions.

### 6.2 Claim Mitigation Evidence

Policyholders may provide evidence of significant risk mitigation efforts undertaken since a claim (e.g., installation of alarm systems post-burglary, completion of defensive driving courses post-accident, repair of property defects causing water damage). This evidence will be considered by Underwriting and may result in a reduction or waiver of an otherwise applicable surcharge. Documentation must be submitted at least 45 days prior to the renewal date.

### 6.3 Subrogation Recoveries

Claims where 100% of the payout was recovered through subrogation will typically not negatively impact renewal eligibility or premium, as the ultimate loss to the Company was zero. Partial recoveries will reduce the effective claim severity for assessment purposes.

## 7. Decision Logic and Workflow

1.  **Automated Initial Assessment (90 days prior to renewal):** System identifies policies with claims history within the look-back period.
2.  **Claim Data Aggregation:** All claims, including status (Open/Closed), payout amounts, and subrogation status, are compiled.
3.  **Tier Classification:** Policy is automatically assigned a Claims Impact Tier (1, 2, or 3) based on criteria in Section 4.1.
4.  **Premium Adjustment Calculation:**
    *   Tier 1: No surcharge,
    *   Tier 2: Surcharge calculated per Section 5.1,
    *   Tier 3: Flagged for Underwriting review.
5.  **Underwriting Review (for Tier 3 policies, or specific exceptions):** A dedicated Underwriter assesses the comprehensive risk profile, including:
    *   Detailed claims narrative.
    *   Policyholder's response to past incidents.
    *   External risk factors (e.g., property location changes, business operations changes).
    *   Decision: Standard Renewal, Modified Renewal Terms (e.g., higher deductible, reduced limits, specific exclusions), or Non-Renewal.
6.  **Notification:** Policyholder is notified of renewal terms, including any premium adjustments or non-renewal decision, in accordance with regulatory requirements (typically 30-60 days prior to renewal).

## 8. Documentation Requirements

For all renewal decisions involving non-standard terms (surcharge, modified terms, non-renewal), the following must be documented in the policy management system:

*   Summary of claims history considered.
*   Specific sections of this policy applied.
*   Calculation of any surcharge.
*   Rationale for modified terms or non-renewal.
*   Any exceptions granted and the basis for the exception.
*   Evidence of policyholder mitigation efforts (if applicable).
