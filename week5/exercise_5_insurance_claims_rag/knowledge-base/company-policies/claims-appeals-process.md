# Claims Appeals Process Policy

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This policy outlines the formal process by which policyholders may appeal an adverse claim decision made by [Your Company Name]. The purpose of this policy is to ensure a fair, transparent, and timely review of claim denials or other unfavorable claim resolutions, providing policyholders with an opportunity to dispute decisions and present additional information for reconsideration. This process is designed to uphold policy terms while addressing policyholder concerns equitably.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all adverse claim decisions issued by [Your Company Name] across all product lines (e.g., auto, home, life, health, commercial liability) to all policyholders with active policies at the time of the claim.

### 2.1. Inclusions

*   Denial of claim in whole or in part.
*   Dispute regarding the amount of a claim payment.
*   Dispute regarding the type or scope of services covered or rendered (e.g., repair vs. replacement).
*   Determination of policy non-coverage for a specific incident.
*   Decisions related to subrogation efforts impacting policyholders.

### 2.2. Exclusions

*   Initial claim submission processing (prior to a decision being rendered).
*   General inquiries about policy coverage or benefits not related to a specific adverse claim decision.
*   Decisions that have already exhausted all internal appeal levels as defined in this policy.
*   Disputes already subject to external regulatory review or litigation.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Policyholder:** The individual or entity insured under an active policy with [Your Company Name].
*   **Claim Representative:** The [Your Company Name] employee initially responsible for processing and deciding a claim.

*   **Appeal Request Form:** The standardized form (available on [Your Company Name] website or by request) that policyholders must complete to initiate an appeal.
*   **Appeals Committee:** A designated committee or senior panel of claims professionals, independent of the initial claim decision, responsible for reviewing escalated appeals.
*   **External Review:** An independent review process, often mandated by state or federal regulations, available to policyholders after exhausting internal appeals.

## 4. Policyholder Claims Appeals Process

The claims appeals process consists of two internal levels designed to provide thorough review.

### 4.1. Level 1 Appeal: Initial Review

#### 4.1.1. Requirements for Submission

*   **Timeframe:** A policyholder must submit a Level 1 appeal request within ninety (90) calendar days from the date of the adverse claim decision notification. For Workers' Compensation claims in California, the timeframe is within one (1) year from the date of the Decision.
*   **Submission Method:** Appeals must be submitted via the official "Appeal Request Form." The form can be downloaded from the policyholder portal at [Your Company Name Appeal Portal URL] or requested by calling Customer Service at 1-800-555-0199.
*   **Required Documentation:**
    *   Completed and signed Appeal Request Form.
    *   Policy number and Claim number.
    *   Clear statement of the reason for the appeal, detailing why the policyholder believes the decision was incorrect.
    *   Any new or additional supporting documentation not previously submitted: medical records, repair estimates, incident reports, witness statements, photographs, appraisal reports, etc.
*   **Submission Address:** All Level 1 appeals must be sent to:
    `[Your Company Name]`
    `Appeals Department - Level 1`
    `P.O. Box 1234`

    Or, uploaded via the secure policyholder portal.

#### 4.1.2. Procedure for Review

1.  **Acknowledgement:** Upon receipt of a Level 1 appeal, [Your Company Name] will send a written acknowledgment to the policyholder within five (5) business days.
2.  **Assignment:** The appeal will be assigned to a senior Claims Adjuster or Claims Supervisor (who was not involved in the initial claim decision).
3.  **Review:** The assigned reviewer will conduct a comprehensive review of the original claim file, the adverse decision rationale, and all new documentation provided by the policyholder. This may include contacting the policyholder, original Claim Representative, or third parties for clarification.
4.  **Decision Logic:**
    *   The reviewer will assess whether the initial decision was consistent with policy language, applicable laws, and all available facts.
    *   Special consideration will be given to new evidence provided by the policyholder.
    *   If new evidence or a re-interpretation of existing policy language warrants a change, the decision will be reversed or modified.
5.  **Notification:** A written decision for the Level 1 appeal will be issued to the policyholder within thirty (30) calendar days of receiving the complete appeal submission. This notification will include:
    *   The outcome of the appeal (uphold, reverse, modify).
    *   A detailed explanation of the decision, referencing specific policy provisions or facts.
    *   Information on how to proceed to a Level 2 Appeal, if the decision remains adverse to the policyholder.

### 4.2. Level 2 Appeal: Appeals Committee Review

#### 4.2.1. Requirements for Submission

*   **Timeframe:** If dissatisfied with the Level 1 Appeal decision, a policyholder may request a Level 2 appeal within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the Level 1 decision notification.
*   **Submission Method:** A written request for Level 2 appeal must be submitted. While an official form is not required for Level 2, clearly state the intent to escalate.
*   **Required Documentation:**
    *   Reference the Level 1 appeal decision letter.
    *   Provide any further new documentation or rationale that was not presented in the Level 1 review, if available. Explain why it was not available previously.

    `P.O. Box 5678`
    `Anytown, State 12345`

#### 4.2.2. Procedure for Review

1.  **Acknowledgement:** Upon receipt of a Level 2 appeal, [Your Company Name] will send a written acknowledgment to the policyholder within five (5) business days.
2.  **Committee Assignment:** The appeal will be presented to the designated Appeals Committee, which typically comprises three (3) senior managers or executives from different departments (e.g., Claims, Underwriting, Legal), none of whom were involved in the Level 1 review.
3.  **Comprehensive Review:** The Appeals Committee will review the entire claim file, including details of the initial decision, the Level 1 appeal, and any new information submitted for the Level 2 appeal. The committee may request additional information or conduct interviews. The committee maintains records of all discussions and decisions for audit purposes.
4.  **Decision Logic:**
    *   The committee evaluates the claim from a holistic perspective, ensuring compliance with policy terms, regulatory requirements, and fair claims practices.
    *   Decisions are made by majority vote of the committee members.
    *   The committee’s decision is final within [Your Company Name]'s internal appeal process.
5.  **Notification:** A written decision for the Level 2 appeal will be issued to the policyholder within sixty (60) calendar days of receiving the complete Level 2 appeal submission. This notification will include:
    *   The definitive outcome of the internal appeal process.
    *   A comprehensive explanation of the committee's decision.
    *   Information regarding the policyholder's right to pursue external review options, including contact information for relevant state insurance departments or other regulatory bodies (e.g., Department of Managed Health Care, if applicable for health claims).

### 4.3. Timelines and Extensions

*   All stated timelines are maximum processing times. [Your Company Name] strives to resolve appeals as quickly as possible.
*   If additional information is required from the policyholder or a third party, the processing timeline may be paused or extended by mutual agreement with notification to the policyholder. Policyholders will be informed of any such delays within five (5) business days of the determination of need for additional information.

## 5. Exceptions

*   **Urgent Care Claims (Health Insurance):** For claims involving immediate medical need where adherence to standard timelines could jeopardize the policyholder's life or health, appeals will be expedited. Decisions will be rendered within seventy-two (72) hours of receipt of all necessary information.
*   **Catastrophic Event Claims:** During officially declared catastrophic events (e.g., hurricanes, widespread wildfires), appeal timelines may be adjusted per regulatory guidance. Policyholders will be notified of any such adjustments.
*   **Disputes under Arbitration Clause:** If a policy contains an arbitration clause, the appeals process will follow the terms outlined in that clause after the Level 1 appeal is exhausted, potentially bypassing Level 2 if specified.

## 6. Evidence and Documentation

Policyholders are responsible for providing all evidence they wish to have considered at each appeal level. All documentation submitted becomes part of the official claim file. [Your Company Name] is committed to maintaining the confidentiality and security of all submitted personal and claim information in accordance with privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA for health claims, state data protection laws).

## 7. Decision Logic for Adjusters and Committee Members

All decisions, whether initial or on appeal, must align with the following hierarchy:

1.  **Policy Contract Terms:** The explicit language of the policy contract, including all endorsements and declarations.
2.  **Applicable Laws and Regulations:** State and federal insurance laws, Department of Insurance regulations, and case law precedent.
3.  **Facts of the Claim:** Verified details, testimony, and evidence gathered during the investigation.
4.  **Fair Claims Practices:** adherence to industry standards, [Your Company Name]'s internal claims handling guidelines, and principles of good faith and fair dealing.

Any deviation must be thoroughly documented and justified.

## 8. Training and Quality Assurance

All Claims Representatives and Appeals Committee members undergo regular training on policy interpretation, regulatory compliance, and fair claims handling practices to ensure consistent and accurate application of this policy. Periodic audits of appeal outcomes are conducted to identify trends and areas for process improvement.
