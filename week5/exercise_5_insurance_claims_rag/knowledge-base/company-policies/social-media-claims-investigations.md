# Social Media in Claims Investigations Policy

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This policy outlines the guidelines and procedures for the ethical and appropriate use of publicly available social media information as an investigative tool in claims management. The purpose is to ensure that investigations are conducted effectively, lawfully, and in compliance with privacy regulations, company values, and ethical standards, while supporting informed decision-making regarding claim validity and resolution. This policy aims to minimize risks associated with privacy breaches, misinterpretation of data, and legal challenges.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all claims personnel, investigators, adjusters, and third-party contractors involved in the investigation and assessment of all types of claims, including but not limited to, property, casualty, liability, health, and disability claims. It covers the collection, analysis, retention, and decision-making processes related to information obtained from social media platforms.

### 2.1. Inclusions

*   Review of publicly accessible information on social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, TikTok, public blogs, online forums).
*   Use of social media as an investigative lead to corroborate or contradict claimant statements, clarify circumstances, or identify potential fraud.
*   Protocols for documenting social media findings.

### 2.2. Exclusions

*   This policy explicitly prohibits accessing or attempting to access private, password-protected social media accounts without legal authorization (e.g., court order, explicit consent).
*   It does not permit "friending," "following," or otherwise directly contacting claimants or related parties under false pretenses or without explicit disclosure of identity and purpose.
*   This policy does not authorize any actions that violate platform terms of service, privacy laws, or company ethical guidelines.
*   Use of social media for general marketing or non-investigative purposes is outside the scope of this policy.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Social Media:** Online platforms and applications that enable users to create and share content or participate in social networking.
*   **Publicly Accessible Information:** Any content or profile information that a social media user has configured to be visible to the general public, without requiring login credentials, friend requests, or special access permissions.
*   **Claimant:** An individual or entity making a claim for benefits or compensation.
*   **Investigator/Claims Personnel:** Any individual authorized by the company to conduct claims investigations.
*   **Misrepresentation:** Making false statements or omissions of material facts.
*   **Fraud:** Deliberate deception to secure unfair or unlawful gain.

## 4. Main Content: Guiding Principles for Social Media Investigations

### 4.1. Legality and Compliance

All social media investigations must comply with applicable federal, state, and local laws, including but not limited to privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, state-specific privacy acts), anti-discrimination laws, and regulations governing insurance investigations. Investigations must also adhere to the terms of service of each social media platform.

### 4.2. Ethical Conduct

Investigators must maintain professional and ethical conduct at all times. This includes:
*   Acting truthfully and transparently where required.
*   Avoiding any deceptive practices, such as creating fake profiles or misrepresenting identity.
*   Respecting individual privacy rights to the greatest extent possible when accessing publicly available information.

### 4.3. Relevance and Necessity

Social media information should only be reviewed when there is a legitimate and reasonable basis to believe it is relevant to the claim investigation. This includes:
*   Corroborating or challenging factual assertions made by the claimant or witnesses.
*   Assessing the credibility of reported injuries, disabilities, or damages.
*   Identifying potential sources of information or evidence relevant to the claim.
*   Investigating suspicious circumstances or potential fraud.

### 4.4. Objectivity

Social media information must be interpreted objectively and not used to prejudge or discriminate against claimants. Conclusions drawn from social media must be supported by verifiable facts and considered alongside all other evidence.

## 5. Requirements and Criteria for Social Media Use

### 5.1. Authorization for Review

*   A claims handler or investigator must have a documented rationale prior to initiating a social media review. This rationale must demonstrate a reasonable belief that publicly available social media information will be relevant to the claim.
*   The rationale should be recorded in the claim file management system.

### 5.2. Permissible Actions

Investigators are permitted to:
*   View and collect publicly accessible content (posts, photos, videos, profiles) from social media platforms.
*   Use standard search engines (e.g., Google, Bing) to identify public social media profiles.
*   Document findings (e.g., screenshots, direct links, observations) in the claims file.

### 5.3. Prohibited Actions

Investigators are strictly prohibited from:
*   Attempting to "friend," "follow," or connect with a claimant or their associates on social media under a false identity.
*   Soliciting or inducing others to "friend" or connect with a claimant on social media on the company's behalf under false pretenses.
*   Accessing or attempting to access non-public, private, or password-protected social media content without a legally sound basis (e.g., court order).
*   Engaging in any conduct that could be perceived as harassment, intimidation, or misrepresentation.
*   Posting comments, questions, or otherwise interacting with claimant content from a company or personal account in an official capacity without explicit management approval and clear disclosure.
*   Using social media to gather personal information unrelated to the claim investigation.

## 6. Procedures for Social Media Investigations

### 6.1. Step 1: Initial Assessment and Rationale Documentation

*   Before commencing a social media search, the claims handler/investigator must articulate the specific reason(s) why social media information is relevant to the claim.
*   Document the initial suspicion or information gap that necessitates the social media review. (e.g., "Claimant asserts total disability from outdoor activities, but public social media posts from [Date Range] show participation in active sports.")

### 6.2. Step 2: Conducting the Search

*   Only publicly available information should be accessed.
*   Use neutral search terms (e.g., claimant's name, reported location, related entities).
*   Do not create fake profiles or use personal accounts to bypass privacy settings. All searches should be conducted using company-approved tools or general public access.

### 6.3. Step 3: Collection and Documentation of Relevant Information

*   If relevant information is found, it must be accurately and meticulously documented. This includes:
    *   **Date and Time of Collection:** Essential for demonstrating the information was publicly available at that specific time.
    *   **Source URL:** Direct link to the specific post or profile.
    *   **Platform Name:** E.g., Facebook, Instagram, X.
    *   **User Profile Name/Handle:** The identity of the poster.
    *   **Content Captured:** Screenshots of the relevant posts, images, or videos. Ensure screenshots capture the date/time stamp of the original post on the platform.
    *   **Description of Relevance:** A brief explanation of why the information is considered relevant to the claim.
*   All collected information must be stored securely within the claim file management system, with appropriate access controls.

### 6.4. Step 4: Analysis and Decision Integration

*   Analyze the collected social media information cautiously, considering context, dates, and potential misinterpretation.
*   Do not rely solely on social media information for claim decisions. It must be corroborated with other evidence (e.g., medical records, witness statements, policy terms).
*   Social media findings should be integrated into the overall investigation report, clearly articulating how the information supports or contradicts other evidence.

### 6.5. Step 5: Retention and Disposal

*   Social media evidence, like all other claim documentation, must be retained according to the company's records retention policy.
*   When claim files are closed and archived, social media documentation should be handled consistently with other investigative materials.

## 7. Exceptions

*   In cases where a court order or subpoena explicitly grants access to private social media information, investigators must follow precise legal counsel directives and document all steps. Such access must never be attempted without formal legal authorization.
*   Information that is clearly satirical, taken out of context, or misattributed should be identified as such and not used to make adverse claim decisions.

## 8. Examples of Relevant Social Media Use

*   **Example 1 (Liability Claim):** A claimant involved in a slip-and-fall incident alleges severe and debilitating back injuries preventing strenuous activity. Publicly accessible photos and videos posted by the claimant on a public social media profile two weeks post-incident show them participating in a marathon. This information would be relevant to assess the consistency of the injury description.
*   **Example 2 (Disability Claim):** A claimant files for long-term disability due to mental health issues making them unable to maintain employment or social interaction. However, their public LinkedIn profile, actively updated, indicates current employment and recent professional achievements. This discrepancy warrants further investigation.
*   **Example 3 (Property Claim):** A claim for significant water damage due to a burst pipe is filed. Public posts by the claimant on a neighborhood Facebook group from three months prior detailing ongoing issues with plumbing leaks and a decision to delay repairs could be relevant to causation and policy conditions.

## 9. Decision Logic (When to Escalate or Act on Social Media Findings)

*   **Direct Contradiction:** If publicly available social media content directly and unambiguously contradicts a material fact provided by the claimant (e.g., injury severity, actual activity levels during reported disability periods, presence at a stated location during an incident).
*   **Fraud Indicators:** If social media content reveals patterns of behavior, statements, or activities strongly indicative of fraudulent intent or misrepresentation.
*   **New Leads/Witnesses:** If social media identifies previously unknown witnesses, potential co-conspirators, or locations/circumstances relevant to the claim's merits.
*   **Credibility Concerns:** If the overall pattern of public social media posts raises significant, objective concerns about the claimant's credibility regarding the reported facts of loss or injury.

In such cases, the social media evidence, along with all other gathered information, should be escalated to a senior claims manager or the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) for further review and potential action.

## 10. Evidence/Documentation

All captured social media evidence must be accompanied by:
*   An audit trail of the search process.
*   Date and timestamp of capture.
*   URL of the source material.
*   The name of the individual who performed the search.
*   A clear statement of the relevance of the evidence to the claim.
*   Confirmation that the information was publicly accessible at the time of capture.

## 11. Timelines

Social media investigations should be conducted promptly at relevant stages of the claim lifecycle, particularly:
*   During initial investigation, if reasonable suspicion arises.
*   Prior to making significant coverage or payment decisions where credibility or factual accuracy is a concern.
*   As part of a fraud investigation.

Searches should be reasonably current to the claim's timeline and the alleged circumstances. Information collected years prior to a claim filed may have less relevance.
