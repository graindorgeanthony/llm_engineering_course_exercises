# Indemnity Limits Guidelines

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This document establishes the official policy for setting and applying indemnity limits across all insurance products and claim types managed by EquiSure Insurance Group. The purpose of these guidelines is to ensure consistency, financial prudence, and compliance with regulatory requirements while providing clear financial boundaries for client coverage. These limits define the maximum financial liability of EquiSure Insurance Group for any single claim or aggregated claims over a specified period, as stipulated in the respective policy schedules.

## 2. Scope

These guidelines apply to all insurance policies underwritten and administered by EquiSure Insurance Group, including but not limited to, Property & Casualty, General Liability, Professional Indemnity, Cyber Risk, and Personal Accident policies. This policy covers all claims handlers, underwriters, legal departments, and financial teams involved in the assessment, approval, and payout of claims.

### 2.1. Inclusions
*   Individual claim limits per incident.
*   Aggregate claim limits per policy period.
*   Specific sub-limits for certain coverage types (e.g., business interruption, data recovery).
*   Maximum defense costs and legal expenses where applicable.

### 2.2. Exclusions
*   Government-mandated schemes or funds where liability is determined by specific statutes outside of policy terms.
*   Claims directly resulting from fraud investigations prior to a payout decision.
*   Ex-gratia payments made outside of standard policy provisions, which require separate executive approval.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Indemnity Limit:** The maximum amount EquiSure Insurance Group will pay out under a policy for a covered loss or series of losses, as specified in the policy schedule.
*   **Per Occurrence Limit:** The maximum amount payable for a single event or incident, regardless of the number of claimants or involved parties.
*   **Aggregate Limit:** The maximum total amount payable for all covered losses occurring within a specified policy period (typically 12 months). Once this limit is reached, EquiSure's liability for further claims ceases until the next policy period, unless specified otherwise.
*   **Sub-limit:** A specific maximum amount within a broader indemnity limit that applies to a particular type of loss, expense, or component of a claim.
*   **Policy Schedule:** The document accompanying the insurance policy that details the specific coverage, limits, deductibles, and premium applicable to an individual policyholder.
*   **Defense Costs:** Legal and other expenses incurred in defending a claim against the insured, which may or may not be included within the indemnity limit, depending on policy wording.

## 4. Main Content: Indemnity Limit Structure

Indemnity limits are determined at the time of policy issuance and are explicitly stated in the policy schedule. They are generally categorized as follows:

### 4.1. Standard Per Occurrence Limits
These limits apply to each distinct claim event. For example, a Property Damage policy might have a "Per Occurrence Limit" of $1,000,000. If two separate incidents occur, each incident will be assessed against this limit.

#### 4.1.1. Typical Per Occurrence Limits by Product Line
*   **General Liability:** $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 per occurrence.
*   **Property & Casualty:** $500,000 to $10,000,000 per occurrence for physical damage.
*   **Professional Indemnity:** $250,000 to $2,000,000 per claim.

### 4.2. Aggregate Limits
These limits cap the total payout for all claims arising within a single policy period. For example, a Business Interruption policy might have an "Aggregate Limit" of $2,000,000, regardless of the number of incidents during the policy year.

#### 4.2.1. Typical Aggregate Limits by Product Line
*   **General Liability:** $2,000,000 to $10,000,000 aggregate.
*   **Professional Indemnity:** $500,000 to $4,000,000 aggregate.
*   **Cyber Risk:** $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 aggregate.

### 4.3. Sub-limits for Specific Coverages
Many policies include sub-limits for specific components of a claim, even if the overall per occurrence or aggregate limit is higher. These are non-negotiable within the policy term.

#### 4.3.1. Examples of Sub-limits
*   **Property Damage:**
    *   Fungus/Mold remediation: $50,000 sub-limit.
    *   Debris removal: $25,000 sub-limit (often 10% of the property limit).
    *   Business Interruption (per month): $100,000 sub-limit.
*   **Cyber Risk:**
    *   Forensic investigation costs: $250,000 sub-limit.
    *   Ransomware payment: $100,000 sub-limit.
    *   Public relations expenses: $50,000 sub-limit.
*   **Professional Indemnity:**
    *   Loss of documents: $100,000 sub-limit.
    *   Defamation/Slander: $75,000 sub-limit.

### 4.4. Defense Costs Handling
Defense costs can be handled in two ways:
1.  **Inside the Limit (E.g., "Costs Inclusive"):** Defense costs reduce the available indemnity limit. If the limit is $1,000,000 and defense costs are $200,000, only $800,000 remains for the actual claim payout.
2.  **Outside the Limit (E.g., "Costs Exclusive"):** Defense costs are paid in addition to the indemnity limit, up to a specified maximum (e.g., additional $500,000 for defense costs). This is typically specified in the policy terms.

Unless explicitly stated as "Costs Exclusive" with a separate limit, defense costs are always considered "Costs Inclusive" and reduce the available indemnity limit.

## 5. Requirements and Criteria

### 5.1. Policy Schedule Adherence
All claim payouts must strictly adhere to the indemnity limits, aggregate limits, and sub-limits specified in the policy schedule of the insured.

### 5.2. Claim Aggregation
When multiple claims arise from a single event or a common cause, they are treated as one occurrence for the purpose of applying the per occurrence limit. Determining what constitutes a "single event" requires careful review by the claims manager, potentially in consultation with legal and underwriting.

#### 5.2.1. Decision Logic for Claim Aggregation
*   **Common Cause:** Claims directly attributable to the same root cause or originating incident (e.g., a single system failure leading to multiple customer data breaches).
*   **Interrelated Acts:** A series of related acts or omissions that result in multiple distinct claims but are fundamentally connected (e.g., a single faulty product design causing injuries across multiple users).
*   **Temporal Proximity:** Claims occurring within a very short, continuous timeframe that are causally linked.

### 5.3. Deductibles and Self-Insured Retentions (SIRs)
The indemnity limit is applied after the deductible or SIR has been satisfied by the insured. Deductibles reduce the payout amount EquiSure Insurance Group is liable for, not the overall indemnity limit.

*   **Example:** A policy with a $1,000,000 limit and a $10,000 deductible. If a claim is $500,000, EquiSure pays $490,000. The remaining limit for future claims is $500,000, not $510,000.

## 6. Procedures for Applying Limits

1.  **Initial Claim Review:** Upon receipt of a claim, the claims handler must identify the policy number and retrieve the relevant policy schedule to determine all applicable indemnity limits, sub-limits, and deductibles/SIRs.
2.  **Estimate Claim Value:** The claims handler estimates the potential financial exposure of the claim, including damages, legal fees, and other associated costs.
3.  **Compare Against Per Occurrence Limit:** Compare the estimated claim value against the per occurrence limit. If the estimate exceeds the limit, the claim payout will be capped at the per occurrence limit.
4.  **Review Aggregate Limit:** Check the current year's aggregate payout history for the specific policy. Sum all previous payouts for the current policy period and add the estimated current claim payout.
    *   If `(Total Previous Payouts + Current Estimated Payout) > Aggregate Limit`, then the current claim payout is capped at `(Aggregate Limit - Total Previous Payouts)`.
5.  **Apply Sub-limits:** For specific categories of loss, verify if sub-limits apply (e.g., data recovery costs, business interruption per month). The payout for that specific category cannot exceed its corresponding sub-limit, even if the overarching per occurrence or aggregate limit is higher.
6.  **Deductible/SIR Application:** Subtract the applicable deductible or SIR from the determined payout amount (after applying limits).
7.  **Documentation:** All calculations, adherence to limits, and reasons for caps must be clearly documented in the claim file (Claim ID: CS-2024-03-IND-01).

## 7. Exceptions

*   **Policy Endorsements:** Any policy endorsements that explicitly modify indemnity limits or sub-limits supersede the standard policy wording and these general guidelines. Such endorsements must be documented and filed with the policy schedule.
*   **Regulatory Overrides:** In rare instances, specific regulatory orders or court judgments may mandate a payout structure that deviates from standard policy limits. These cases require immediate escalation to the Legal Department and Senior Claims Management (VP of Claims, Reference: RM-2024-01-REG).
*   **Reinstatement of Limits:** Some policies may offer a "reinstatement of limits" clause, allowing the aggregate limit to be restored after being partially or fully exhausted, typically for an additional premium. This must be explicitly stated in the policy schedule and approved by underwriting.

## 8. Examples

### 8.1. Example 1: Per Occurrence and Aggregate Limit Application
*   **Policy:** General Liability Policy #GL-789012
*   **Limits:**
    *   Per Occurrence: $1,000,000
    *   Aggregate: $2,000,000
*   **Claim History (current policy period):**
    *   Claim #1 (August 1, 2023): $750,000 paid for bodily injury.
    *   Claim #2 (November 15, 2023): $600,000 paid for property damage.
*   **Current Claim (March 10, 2024 - Claim ID: GL-2024-03001):**
    *   Estimated liability: $800,000 for a new bodily injury incident.

**Decision:**
1.  **Per Occurrence Check:** $800,000 is less than the $1,000,000 per occurrence limit. This check passes.
2.  **Aggregate Check:**
    *   Total paid so far: $750,000 + $600,000 = $1,350,000
    *   Remaining Aggregate Limit: $2,000,000 - $1,350,000 = $650,000
    *   Since the current estimated payout ($800,000) exceeds the remaining aggregate limit ($650,000), the payout for Claim GL-2024-03001 will be capped at $650,000.
3.  **Final Payout:** $650,000. The aggregate limit is now exhausted.

### 8.2. Example 2: Sub-limit Application
*   **Policy:** Cyber Risk Policy #CY-123456
*   **Limits:**
    *   Per Occurrence: $2,000,000
    *   Aggregate: $3,000,000
    *   **Sub-limit for Ransomware Payment:** $100,000
    *   **Sub-limit for Data Recovery:** $250,000
*   **Current Claim (April 5, 2024 - Claim ID: CY-2024-04002):**
    *   Estimated Costs:
        *   Ransomware payment: $150,000
        *   Data Recovery: $300,000
        *   Forensic Investigation: $400,000
*   **Deductible:** $25,000

**Decision:**
1.  **Ransomware Payout:** Capped at the sub-limit of $100,000 (even though paid $150,000).
2.  **Data Recovery Payout:** Capped at the sub-limit of $250,000 (even though estimated $300,000).
3.  **Forensic Investigation Payout:** $400,000 (no specific sub-limit mentioned, falls under the main limit).
4.  **Total Gross Payout:** $100,000 + $250,000 + $400,000 = $750,000
5.  **Per Occurrence Check:** $750,000 is less than the $2,000,000 per occurrence limit. This check passes.
6.  **Aggregate Check:** Assuming no prior claims in the policy period, $750,000 is less than the $3,000,000 aggregate limit. This check passes.
7.  **Apply Deductible:** $750,000 - $25,000 = $725,000.
8.  **Final Payout:** $725,000.

## 9. Evidence/Documentation

All claims documentation must explicitly record the applicable indemnity limits and demonstrate how these limits (including sub-limits and aggregate limits) were applied in determining the final payout.

*   Copies of the policy schedule and all relevant endorsements.
*   Detailed claim cost estimations.
*   Calculation worksheets for payouts, clearly showing limit applications.
*   Approval records from authorized personnel if exceeding standard payout authority thresholds (refer to Delegated Authority Matrix DM-2023-09-CLAIMS).

## 10. Timelines

*   **Policy Review (Underwriting):** Indemnity limits are finalized during the policy issuance or renewal process.
*   **Claims Processing:** Limits are applied at the time of claim assessment and before final approval for payout.
*   **Annual Review:** These guidelines will be reviewed annually by the Claims Management and Underwriting departments, with updates published by March 1st of each year, following legal and compliance review.
