# Reinsurance Claims Process Policy

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This policy outlines the standardized process for the effective and timely submission, management, and recovery of claims from our reinsurance partners. The primary purpose is to ensure compliance with reinsurance treaty terms, maximize financial recovery, maintain accurate records, and facilitate efficient communication with reinsurers. Adherence to this policy is critical for mitigating financial exposure and preserving the company's financial stability.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all claims personnel, finance departments, and third-party administrators (TPAs) involved in the identification, preparation, submission, and tracking of claims that are eligible for recovery under any in-force reinsurance treaty.

**Inclusions:**
*   All claims impacting treaty or facultative reinsurance agreements.
*   Claims for property, casualty, marine, aviation, and special risk lines of business where reinsurance is in effect.
*   Interim and final claims submissions.
*   Commutation requests involving reinsurers.

**Exclusions:**
*   Direct insurance claims processing (covered under the General Claims Handling Policy).
*   Claims where no reinsurance coverage is applicable.
*   Internal accounting adjustments not related to reinsurance recoveries.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Cedant:** The primary insurer (our company) that cedes risk to a reinsurer.
*   **Reinsurer:** The entity assuming risk from the cedant.
*   **Treaty Reinsurance:** An agreement where the reinsurer automatically accepts all risks within a defined class of business, subject to certain limits and conditions.
*   **Facultative Reinsurance:** An agreement that covers a single, specific risk or a defined group of risks, with both the cedant and reinsurer having the option to decline or accept.
*   **Retention:** The portion of the risk (or claim amount) that the Cedant retains for its own account before reinsurance coverage applies.
*   **Loss Advice Notification:** Initial notification to the reinsurer of a potentially reinsurable loss event.
*   **Claims Submission Dossier:** A complete package of documentation required by the reinsurer to process a claim.
*   **Ultimate Net Loss (UNL):** The gross loss sustained by the Cedant less all recoveries other than reinsurance recoveries. This is the basis most commonly used for calculating reinsurance claims.
*   **Experience Account:** A system for tracking cumulative losses and premiums under certain types of reinsurance treaties (e.g., XL treaties).

## 4. Reinsurance Claims Process

The reinsurance claims process is divided into several key stages:

### 4.1. Claim Identification and Initial Assessment

1.  **Claim Identification:** Upon receipt of a new primary claim, the claims handler must identify if the claim has potential reinsurance implications based on its estimated value, nature, and line of business.
    *   **Trigger:** Estimated Gross Loss exceeds 50% of the treaty's attachment point or internal retention threshold ($50,000 for standard property treaties, $100,000 for liability treaties, $25,000 for specific marine policies).
    *   **Action:** Mark the claim file in the Claim Management System (CMS) with the "Reinsurance Review Required" flag and associate the relevant treaty ID.
2.  **Initial Treaty Review:** The Reinsurance Claims Specialist reviews the associated reinsurance treaties (Treaty Register Lookup) to confirm coverage applicability, retention levels, limits, and specific reporting requirements (e.g., notice periods).

### 4.2. Loss Advice Notification (LAN)

1.  **Timing:** For claims identified in 4.1, a Loss Advice Notification (LAN) must be generated and sent to the relevant reinsurer(s) within the treaty-stipulated timeframe (typically 30-90 days from notification of loss to the Cedant, or when the Cedant's estimated loss exceeds 50% of its retention).
2.  **Content of LAN:**
    *   Cedant Claim Number
    *   Date of Loss
    *   Type of Loss (Peril)
    *   Estimated Gross Loss
    *   Estimated Net Loss (Cedant's Retention)
    *   Reinsurer's Share of Estimated Loss
    *   Policyholder Name
    *   Brief description of the loss event.
    *   Relevant Reinsurance Treaty Name/Number.
3.  **Method:** LANs are typically sent via email to the reinsurer's designated claims contact or through a secure electronic platform (e.g., ACORD messaging).
4.  **Documentation:** A copy of the sent LAN and confirmation of receipt must be saved in the electronic claim file. Updates to the estimated loss exceeding a 25% variance from prior estimates will require an updated LAN.

### 4.3. Claims Submission Dossier Preparation

Once a claim payment to the policyholder is finalized or a significant reserve change occurs impacting reinsurance, a comprehensive Claims Submission Dossier is prepared.

1.  **Data Collection:** The Reinsurance Claims Specialist compiles all necessary documentation:
    *   Cedant's internal claim file summary.
    *   Proof of loss (e.g., adjuster reports, appraisal reports, invoices, repair estimates).
    *   Evidence of Cedant's policy coverage (policy declaration page, relevant endorsements).
    *   Proof of payment to the policyholder (canceled checks, payment registers).
    *   Calculation of Ultimate Net Loss (UNL), clearly showing gross loss less salvage and subrogation recoveries.
    *   Detailed computation of the reinsurer's share according to treaty terms.
    *   Subrogation potential/recoveries (if applicable).
    *   Legal opinions or court judgments (for liability claims).
    *   Any communications or agreements with the policyholder concerning the loss.
2.  **Quality Assurance:** The Reinsurance Claims Manager reviews the dossier for completeness, accuracy, and adherence to treaty clauses.
3.  **Submission Timeline:** Full claims dossiers must be submitted to the reinsurer within 90 days of the Cedant's final payment to the policyholder, or within 30 days of significant reserve increase that impacts the reinsurer's share, unless otherwise specified in the treaty.

### 4.4. Reinsurer Communication and Follow-up

1.  **Acknowledgement:** Reinsurers are expected to acknowledge receipt of the claims submission within 10 business days.
2.  **Query Resolution:** The Reinsurance Claims Specialist is responsible for promptly responding to any queries or requests for additional information from the reinsurer. All correspondence must be documented.
3.  **Escalation:** If a reinsurer fails to acknowledge outstanding claims or respond to queries within 30 days, the Reinsurance Claims Manager must escalate the issue via formal written communication and schedule a direct follow-up call.
4.  **Disputed Claims:** In cases of disputed claims, the Reinsurance Claims Manager, in consultation with legal/actuarial teams, will attempt to negotiate a resolution. Unresolved disputes will be escalated to the Head of Reinsurance and potentially involve arbitration as per treaty terms.

### 4.5. Recovery and Reconciliation

1.  **Payment Collection:** Upon approval, the reinsurer will issue payment. The Finance department is responsible for tracking expected recoveries and reconciling received payments against outstanding balances.
2.  **System Update:** Upon receipt of funds, the Reinsurance Claims Specialist must update the CMS to reflect the recovery, closing the reinsurance claim segment.
3.  **Accounting:** All recovered funds are to be allocated to the appropriate general ledger accounts as per established accounting procedures.

### 4.6. Commutations

From time to time, reinsurers may request or participate in a commutation of outstanding liabilities.

1.  **Review:** All commutation proposals must be reviewed by the Reinsurance Claims Manager, Finance Department, and Actuarial Department.
2.  **Approval:** Commutations impacting an ultimate net loss recovery of $1,000,000 or more require approval from the CFO. Those below $1,000,000 but above $250,000 require approval from the Head of Reinsurance.
3.  **Documentation:** All commutation agreements must be formally documented and signed by authorized representatives of both parties and stored in the electronic treaty file and relevant claim files.

## 5. Requirements and Criteria

*   **Treaty Adherence:** All claims processing must strictly adhere to the terms and conditions of the specific reinsurance treaty.
*   **Documentation Standards:** All claim files must be complete, accurate, and easily auditable. Missing or incomplete documentation may result in delayed or denied recoveries.
*   **Timeliness:** All notifications and submissions must meet or exceed the deadlines stipulated in the reinsurance treaties to avoid potential coverage challenges.
*   **Data Integrity:** All data entered into the CMS and related financial systems must be validated regularly to ensure accuracy.
*   **Regulatory Compliance:** All claims handling practices must comply with relevant insurance regulations and financial reporting standards.

## 6. Exceptions

Any deviation from this policy must be formally documented and approved by the Head of Reinsurance or, for significant financial impacts (over $500,000), by the CFO. Exceptions will only be granted under extraordinary circumstances, such as:
*   Force majeure events preventing timely submission.
*   Specific written agreements with reinsurers for alternative processes.
*   Complex claims requiring extended investigation, with prior reinsurer agreement.

## 7. Examples

### Example 1: Timely Loss Advice Notification

*   **Scenario:** A property claim with an estimated gross loss of $1,500,000 is reported to the Cedant on October 5, 2023. The applicable reinsurance treaty has a $500,000 retention and requires LANs within 60 days of claim notification or when estimated loss exceeds 50% of retention.
*   **Action:** The Reinsurance Claims Specialist identifies this claim on October 7, 2023, as meeting the LAN trigger ($1.5M > $0.5M). A Loss Advice Notification is prepared and sent to the reinsurer on October 15, 2023, well within the 60-day window. The CMS is updated to reflect the LAN submission date.

### Example 2: Incomplete Claims Dossier

*   **Scenario:** A liability claim with an ultimate net loss of $2,000,000 is submitted to the reinsurer. The reinsurer requests a copy of the legal judgment and all invoices related to defense costs, which were inadvertently omitted from the initial dossier.
*   **Consequence:** The reinsurer places the claim on hold, significantly delaying payment.
*   **Resolution:** The Reinsurance Claims Specialist immediately compiles the missing documents and resubmits the complete dossier, along with an apology for the oversight. The delay in recovery impacts cash flow metrics.

## 8. Decision Logic for Reinsurance Allocation

The decision to allocate a claim to a specific reinsurance treaty is based on the following hierarchy, applied through the CMS and reviewed by the Reinsurance Claims Specialist:

1.  **Policy Coverage Date:** The date of loss must fall within the effective period of the primary policy.
2.  **Treaty Effective Date:** The primary policy must be incepted during the effective period of the relevant reinsurance treaty.
3.  **Line of Business Match:** The claim's line of business (e.g., Property, General Liability) must match the perils covered by the treaty.
4.  **Retention Application:** The Ultimate Net Loss must exceed the Cedant's retention as defined in the treaty.
5.  **Per Occurrence/Aggregate Limits:** Verify the claim does not exceed per-occurrence limits, or if it contributes to aggregate limits, ensure sufficient aggregate capacity remains.
6.  **Specific Exclusions:** Review the treaty for any specific exclusions that might preclude coverage for the particular loss event.

If multiple treaties could potentially apply (e.g., multiple layers of excess-of-loss treaties), the system routes the claim to the lowest applicable layer based on the UNL, then progressively to higher layers if the UNL exceeds the lower layer's limit. For complex cases involving multiple treaties or facultative certificates per primary policy, manual review by the Reinsurance Claims Manager is required.

## 9. Evidence and Documentation

All supporting documentation for reinsurance claims must be:
*   Scanned and stored digitally in the respective electronic claim file within the CMS.
*   Clearly indexed and labeled.
*   Retained for a minimum of 7 years post-claim closure, or as required by regulatory bodies or treaty terms, whichever is longer.
*   Available for internal and external audit.

Required evidence includes, but is not limited to:
*   Primary policy wording and endorsements.
*   Proof of loss documentation (e.g., adjuster reports, photos, expert reports).
*   Invoices for repairs/replacement, legal fees, and other incurred expenses.
*   Payment records to policyholders.
*   Salvage and subrogation recovery records.
*   Correspondence with policyholders, brokers, and reinsurers.
*   Internal claim notes and approvals.

## 10. Timelines

*   **Loss Advice Notification (LAN):** Within 30-90 days of Cedant's notification of loss, or when estimated gross loss exceeds 50% of retention (refer to specific treaty clauses).
*   **Claims Dossier Submission:** Within 90 days of Cedant's final payment to policyholder or significant reserve increase impacting reinsurance.
*   **Reinsurer Response to Queries:** Within 15 business days.
*   **Reinsurer Payment Processing:** Within 30 business days of claim approval, or as per treaty terms.
*   **Internal Reconciliation:** Within 5 business days of receipt of reinsurer payment.

These timelines are critical to ensure compliance with "prompt notice" clauses in treaties and to optimize cash flow from reinsurance recoveries. Failure to adhere to these timelines may jeopardize claim recovery.
