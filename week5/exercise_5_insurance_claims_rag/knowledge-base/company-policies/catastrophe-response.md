# Catastrophe Claims Response Policy

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This policy outlines the procedures and guidelines for effectively managing claims arising from a Catastrophic Event. The primary purpose is to ensure a swift, coordinated, and client-focused response to large-scale disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, widespread wildfires, or significant floods, minimizing client disruption and maximizing claims resolution efficiency. This policy establishes the framework for activating the Catastrophe Response Team (CRT), allocating resources, communicating with stakeholders, and processing claims under extraordinary circumstances.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all claims personnel, departmental managers, executive leadership, and third-party vendors involved in the claims handling process within areas declared a "Catastrophic Event Zone" by relevant governmental authorities or by internal company declaration based on the severity and scale of the event.

**Included:**
* Activation criteria for Catastrophe Response.
* Roles and responsibilities during a Catastrophic Event.
* Procedures for emergency claim intake, assessment, and resolution.
* Resource deployment and allocation guidelines.
* Communication protocols for clients, regulators, and internal stakeholders.

**Excluded:**
* Day-to-day claims handling of individual, isolated incidents not classified as part of a Catastrophic Event.
* Specific financial reserving policies (these are covered under the "Claims Reserving Policy").
* Detailed IT disaster recovery plans (these are covered under the "Business Continuity Plan").

## 3. Definitions

*   **Catastrophic Event (CAT Event):** A severe natural or man-made disaster impacting a large geographical area or a significant number of policyholders, leading to an extraordinary volume of claims that exceeds normal claims processing capacity. Typically declared based on government declarations (e.g., FEMA disaster declaration) or internal company assessment of anticipated claims volume and severity (e.g., 5,000+ claims anticipated in a 48-hour period from a single event).
*   **Catastrophe Response Team (CRT):** A dedicated, cross-functional team activated during a CAT Event to manage and coordinate the company's response efforts.
*   **CAT Zone:** The geographical area officially declared as impacted by a Catastrophic Event.
*   **Claims Surge:** An abnormal increase in claim filings following a CAT Event.
*   **Emergency Adjuster:** An adjuster, internal or external, specifically assigned to handle claims within a CAT Zone, often deployed from outside the affected area.
*   **Policyholder Outreach:** Proactive communication with policyholders in a CAT Zone to offer assistance and outline claims procedures.
*   **Temporary Operational Center (TOC):** A temporary facility established within or near a CAT Zone to support claims operations and policyholder interactions.

## 4. Declaration and Activation of Catastrophe Response

### 4.1. Declaration Criteria

A CAT Event will be declared and the Catastrophe Response Policy activated when one or more of the following conditions are met:

*   **Governmental Declaration:** A national, state, or provincial disaster declaration is issued for an event impacting our policyholders.
*   **Claims Volume Threshold:** Projections indicate a Claims Surge of over 5,000 new claims within a 48-hour period for a single event.
*   **Property Damage Threshold:** Anticipated insured property damage exceeds $50 million for a single event.
*   **Widespread Impact:** Significant and widespread infrastructure damage affecting the ability of policyholders to report claims or our ability to service them.

### 4.2. Activation Process

1.  **Initial Assessment (within 2 hours of event knowledge):** The Head of Claims, in conjunction with the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) and Underwriting, will assess the potential impact based on weather reports, seismic data, and initial reports.
2.  **Declaration Decision (within 4 hours):** Based on the assessment, the ELT will make a formal declaration of a CAT Event.
3.  **CRT Activation (within 6 hours):** Upon declaration, the designated CRT Lead will activate the Catastrophe Response Team via secure notification system.
4.  **Policyholder Communication Strategy (within 12 hours):** The Marketing and Communications department, guided by the CRT Lead, will develop and initiate policyholder outreach.

## 5. Catastrophe Response Team (CRT) Structure and Roles

The CRT is led by a designated CRT Lead (typically the VP of Claims or a senior director) and comprises representatives from key departments:

### 5.1. Core CRT Members

*   **CRT Lead:** Overall strategic direction, external stakeholder liaisons (regulators, government agencies), budget approval for surge capacity. Responsible for daily operational briefings to ELT.
*   **Claims Operations Representative (Property/Auto/Commercial):** Manages surge claims intake, triage, assignment, and processing. Oversees adjuster deployment (internal and external) and claims workflow optimization for CAT claims.
*   **Human Resources Representative:** Addresses staffing needs, provides support for deployed personnel, manages employee well-being in affected areas.
*   **IT Representative:** Ensures system stability, remote access, mobile capabilities, and supports data analytics for CAT claims.
*   **Communications/Marketing Representative:** Handles policyholder outreach, public relations, and internal communications.
*   **Finance Representative:** Manages emergency funding, claims payments, and financial reporting specific to the CAT Event.
*   **Legal & Compliance Representative:** Provides guidance on regulatory requirements, emergency declarations, and contractual obligations.

### 5.2. Supporting Roles (as needed)

*   **Vendor Management:** Coordinates with third-party adjusters, restoration companies, and other vendors.
*   **Underwriting Liaison:** Addresses policy interpretation questions specific to the event, coverage verification.
*   **Training & Quality Assurance:** Provides rapid training for redeployed staff and monitors claims quality.

## 6. Claims Handling Procedures During a CAT Event

### 6.1. Prioritization and Triage

All incoming claims from a CAT Zone will be immediately flagged as "CAT Priority." Claims will be triaged based on severity and policyholder vulnerability:

1.  **Critical Needs:** Claims involving total loss, uninhabitable dwellings, severe injuries, or confirmed fatalities. **Action:** Immediate assignment (within 4 hours of receipt) to an Emergency Adjuster for initial contact and needs assessment.
2.  **Severe Damage:** Claims involving significant structural damage, major water intrusion, or extensive vehicle damage. **Action:** Assignment within 24 hours for initial contact and inspection scheduling.
3.  **Moderate Damage:** Claims involving reparable damage not immediately impacting habitability or vehicle functionality. **Action:** Assignment within 48 hours for contact and assessment.
4.  **Minor Damage/Loss:** Claims involving cosmetic damage, minor contents loss, or other non-urgent issues. **Action:** Assignment within 72 hours, with initial contact potentially made through a claims support specialist or automated system.

### 6.2. Accelerated Claim Intake

*   **Dedicated CAT Claims Hotline:** A toll-free number (e.g., 1-800-CAT-CLAIM, active within 2 hours of declaration) and online portal will be established for rapid claim reporting.
*   **Simplified Reporting:** The initial claim report form/process will be streamlined to capture essential information only (policyholder name, policy number, loss address, brief description of damage, contact information). Detailed documentation can follow.
*   **FNOL Automation:** Leverage IVR and online tools for First Notice of Loss (FNOL) to reduce call center wait times.

### 6.3. Adjuster Deployment and Management

*   **Internal Deployment:** Qualified claims adjusters from unaffected regions will be identified and, if available/willing, deployed to the CAT Zone. Deployment duration typically 2-4 weeks.
*   **External Adjusters (IA's):** Contracts with Independent Adjusting (IA) firms will be activated immediately upon CAT declaration. IA firms are required to prioritize our claims for adjuster deployment based on pre-negotiated service levels.
*   **Mobile Adjusting Units:** Field adjusters will be equipped with mobile claims technology for onsite claim input, photo/video capture, and potentially initial payment processing.
*   **CAT Command Center:** A virtual or physical command center will be established to coordinate adjuster deployment, assignments, and provide logistical support. All adjusters in a CAT Zone must check-in daily.

### 6.4. Expedited Payment Procedures

*   **Advanced Payments:** For total loss or uninhabitable property claims, an urgent advance payment (e.g., up to $5,000 for immediate needs) may be authorized by the assigned adjuster or team lead without full documentation, provided there is clear evidence of loss and coverage. All such advances require management approval (Claims Team Lead level or higher).
*   **Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT):** Policyholders will be encouraged to opt for EFT for faster payment delivery.
*   **Temporary Living Expenses (ALE):** Immediate authorization for temporary living expenses (ALE) will be granted for policyholders whose homes are deemed uninhabitable, up to the policy sub-limit, without requiring extensive initial documentation. Receipts will be required for reimbursement later.

### 6.5. Documentation and Evidence

*   **Photos/Videos:** Policyholders will be encouraged to submit photos and videos of damage through the online portal or mobile app.
*   **Simplified Evidence:** In cases of widespread damage where detailed receipts may be lost, reasonable estimates and consistent damage patterns across the CAT Zone may be accepted as proof of loss, subject to review.
*   **Third-Party Reports:** Acceptance of official reports from emergency services, building inspectors, or community assessments to corroborate damage.

## 7. Resource Allocation

### 7.1. Staffing

*   **Internal Redeployment:** Cross-training programs ensure claims staff can be temporarily re-assigned to CAT claims during a surge.
*   **Overtime:** Authorized overtime for claims staff involved in CAT response, following HR guidelines.
*   **Temporary Staffing:** Engagement of temporary administrative or claims support staff through pre-approved agencies.

### 7.2. Technology

*   **Mobile Claims Toolkit:** Provision of laptops, tablets, satellite phones (if necessary), and portable power to field adjusters.
*   **System Scalability:** IT monitors and scales claims management systems to handle increased transaction volumes.
*   **Digital Communication Platforms:** Use of SMS, email, and social media for mass communication with policyholders.

### 7.3. Physical Logistics

*   **Temporary Operational Centers (TOCs):** Establishment of TOCs near severely impacted areas for policyholder meetings and claims processing if suitable infrastructure is available. These will be equipped with power, internet (satellite if needed), and basic supplies.
*   **Support Vehicles:** Deployment of claims support vehicles capable of rapid response and carrying essential supplies.

## 8. Communication Plan

### 8.1. Policyholder Communication

*   **Initial Notification (within 12 hours of CAT declaration):** Proactive outreach via email, SMS, and website announcements informing impacted policyholders how to report claims and what to expect.
*   **Regular Updates:** Consistent updates on claim processing status, expected timelines, and recovery resources via multiple channels.
*   **Empathy and Support:** All communications will be delivered with empathy, providing clear instructions and reassurance.

### 8.2. Internal Communication

*   **Daily CRT Briefings:** Regular meetings (daily, or more frequently if needed) for the CRT to assess progress, address challenges, and adjust strategies.
*   **ELT Updates:** CRT Lead provides daily summary reports to the Executive Leadership Team.
*   **Company-Wide Bulletins:** Regular updates to all employees on the company's response efforts and ways to assist.

### 8.3. Regulatory and Stakeholder Communication

*   **Immediate Notification:** Regulators (e.g., state insurance departments) will be notified within 24 hours of a CAT declaration, outlining the company's response plan.
*   **Ongoing Reporting:** Provide regulators with regular updates on claims volumes, processing times, and any consumer complaints as required.
*   **Media Relations:** All media inquiries will be directed to the Head of Communications/Marketing and the CRT Lead.

## 9. Exceptions

In extraordinary circumstances, deviations from this policy may be authorized by the CRT Lead in consultation with relevant executive leadership members. Any such exceptions must be documented, including the rationale, date, and approving parties. This typically applies to:

*   Extensions to processing deadlines due to extreme access limitations (e.g., roads impassable for extended periods).
*   Temporary relaxation of certain documentation requirements for small claims when widespread damage makes standard evidence collection impossible.
*   Authorization of emergency expenditures exceeding standard limits for critical humanitarian aid to policyholders.

## 10. Post-Catastrophe Review

Within 30 days of the official stand-down of the CAT Response Team, a comprehensive post-mortem review will be conducted. This review will include:

*   Analysis of claims volume, average processing times, and settlement ratios.
*   Assessment of communication effectiveness (internal and external).
*   Review of resource allocation and utilization.
*   Feedback from adjusters, policyholders, and vendors.
*   Identification of lessons learned and recommendations for policy and procedural improvements.

The findings from this review will be documented and used to update this policy and related operational plans.
