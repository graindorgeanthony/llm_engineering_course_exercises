# Life Insurance Eligibility Criteria Policy

## Overview
This policy outlines the necessary criteria and documentation required for a beneficiary to be deemed eligible to file a claim under a life insurance policy issued by [Insurance Company Name]. The purpose is to ensure claims are processed accurately, promptly, and in accordance with policy terms and legal requirements, preventing fraudulent or ineligible claims.

## Scope
This policy applies to all life insurance policies issued by [Insurance Company Name], including term life, whole life, universal life, and variable universal life policies, and all associated beneficiaries named within these policies. It covers the eligibility requirements for filing a claim upon the death of the insured. It does not cover the eligibility for policy issuance or premium payment terms.

## Definitions
*   **Insured:** The individual whose life is covered by the life insurance policy.
*   **Policyholder:** The individual or entity who owns the life insurance policy and has the right to exercise its privileges. Often the same as the Insured, but can be different.
*   **Beneficiary:** The individual(s) or entity(ies) designated by the policyholder to receive the policy proceeds upon the death of the insured.
*   **Claimant:** The individual or entity submitting a claim for life insurance benefits. Usually the Beneficiary, but may also include legal representatives.
*   **Proof of Death:** Official documentation verifying the death of the insured, typically a certified death certificate.
*   **Claim Form:** The official document provided by [Insurance Company Name] that the beneficiary must complete to initiate the claim process.

## Main Eligibility Requirements

For a claim to be considered eligible for processing, the following primary criteria must be met:

### 1. Valid Life Insurance Policy
There must be a valid, in-force life insurance policy issued by [Insurance Company Name] covering the deceased individual as the insured.
*   The policy must not have lapsed due to non-payment of premiums.
*   The policy must not have been surrendered or terminated prior to the date of death.
*   Any contestability periods must have expired, or the claim must fall outside of contested circumstances (e.g., suicide clause).

### 2. Designated Beneficiary Status
The claimant must be the officially designated beneficiary on record for the policy at the time of the insured's death.
*   **Primary Beneficiary:** The first individual(s) or entity(ies) entitled to receive the policy proceeds.
*   **Contingent Beneficiary:** If all primary beneficiaries are deceased, the contingent beneficiary(ies) become eligible.
*   **Bylaw/Estate Claimants:** If no named beneficiaries are alive, or if the designation is unclear, the proceeds may be payable to the insured's estate, requiring the claimant to be the legally appointed executor or administrator of the estate.

### 3. Valid Proof of Death
The claimant must provide satisfactory evidence of the insured's death.

## Requirements for Claim Submission

### Evidence/Documentation Required:

1.  **Completed Claim Form:** The official "Life Insurance Beneficiary Claim Form" provided by [Insurance Company Name], fully completed and signed by the claimant.
2.  **Certified Death Certificate:** A certified copy of the deceased insured's death certificate.
    *   The death certificate must include the cause and manner of death.
    *   For deaths occurring outside the country of policy domicile, an officially translated and apostilled death certificate may be required.
3.  **Proof of Claimant's Identity:** A valid, government-issued photo identification (e.g., driver's license, passport) for each beneficiary filing the claim.
4.  **Proof of Relationship to Insured (if applicable):**
    *   Birth certificate (for child beneficiaries)
    *   Marriage certificate (for spouse beneficiaries)
    *   Adoption papers (for adopted child beneficiaries)
    *   Legal documentation (e.g., guardianship papers, power of attorney, trust agreement) for beneficiaries who are minors, incapacitated, or acting on behalf of an entity or trust.
5.  **Policy Number:** The policy number of the life insurance contract under which the claim is being filed.
6.  **Additional Documentation (as may be requested):**
    *   Medical records (especially in cases where death occurred within the contestability period or involves unusual circumstances).
    *   Police reports or accident reports (in cases of accidental death).
    *   Coroner's report or toxicology results.
    *   Legal documents related to probate, estate administration, or beneficiary disputes.

### Decision Logic for Eligibility:

*   **Step 1: Policy Validation:**
    *   Is policy in force on date of death? (Yes/No)
    *   Has the contestability period expired, or does the claim fall outside contestable conditions? (Yes/No)
    *   **If No to any:** Claim may be denied or require further investigation by Claims Review Committee.
*   **Step 2: Beneficiary Verification:**
    *   Is claimant named as a primary, contingent, or rightful successor beneficiary on record? (Yes/No)
    *   Does claimant's identity match the provided ID? (Yes/No)
    *   **If No to any:** Claim may be disputed or require legal review.
*   **Step 3: Proof of Death Verification:**
    *   Is a certified death certificate provided? (Yes/No)
    *   Does the death certificate identify the insured? (Yes/No)
    *   Is the date of death consistent with policy timelines? (Yes/No)
    *   **If No to any:** Claim is pended for required documentation.

## Exceptions
*   **Missing or Incomplete Documentation:** Claims submitted with missing or incomplete documentation will be placed on hold, and the claimant will be notified with a request for the required information within [30] days. Failure to provide information may result in claim closure.
*   **Disputed Beneficiary:** If there are multiple claimants or a dispute regarding the rightful beneficiary, benefits may be interpleaded into a court of law, or internal legal counsel will advise on benefit disbursement.
*   **Death During Contestability Period:** If the insured's death occurs within the first [2] years of the policy's issue date, the death will be subject to a more thorough review, including medical underwriting re-evaluation and investigation into the policy application for material misrepresentation. This may delay claim processing.
*   **Suicide Clause:** Most policies contain a suicide clause (typically for the first [2] years). If death is determined to be by suicide within this period, benefits may be limited to a refund of premiums paid, as per the specific policy terms, and may not fully pay out the death benefit.
*   **Accidental Death Benefit Riders:** For policies with an Accidental Death Benefit rider, additional specific documentation (e.g., police reports, autopsy results) will be required to determine if the death qualifies as accidental under the rider's terms.

## Timelines
*   **Initial Acknowledgment:** [Insurance Company Name] will acknowledge receipt of a claim within [5] business days of receiving the completed claim form.
*   **Decision Timeline:** Upon receipt of all required documentation, a decision on eligibility and benefit disbursement will typically be made within [30] business days. Complex cases, those within the contestability period, or those requiring extensive investigation may take longer. Claimants will be notified of any significant delays.
*   **Benefit Payment:** Eligible benefits will be disbursed within [3-5] business days following an approval decision.

## Examples
**Example 1: Eligible Claim**
*   **Insured:** John Smith
*   **Beneficiary:** Jane Smith (Spouse)

*   **Documentation Provided:** Completed claim form, certified death certificate for John Smith, Jane Smith's driver's license, marriage certificate.

*   **Policy Status:** In force, issued 10 years ago.
*   **Documentation Provided:** Completed claim form, photocopy of death certificate (not certified), David Garcia's ID.
*   **Eligibility Decision:** **Pended**. Certified death certificate required. Claim processing will resume once the certified document is received.

**Example 3: Potentially Ineligible/Contestable Claim**
*   **Insured:** Robert Jones
*   **Beneficiary:** Sarah Jones (Spouse)
*   **Policy Status:** In force, issued 18 months ago.
*   **Documentation Provided:** Completed claim form, certified death certificate indicating cause of death as "respiratory failure due to undisclosed pre-existing condition." Sarah Jones's ID.
