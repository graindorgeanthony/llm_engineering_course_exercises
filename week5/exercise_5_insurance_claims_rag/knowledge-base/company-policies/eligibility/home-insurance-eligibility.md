# Home Insurance Eligibility Criteria

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This document outlines the standard eligibility criteria that property owners must meet to qualify for home insurance policies and subsequent claims processing underwritten by [Insurance Company Name]. The purpose is to ensure that properties meet minimum risk standards, maintain policy compliance, and allow for efficient and fair claims assessment. Adherence to these criteria is fundamental for policy issuance and the validation of all submitted claims.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all new and renewal home insurance applications and all current policyholders submitting claims related to residential properties. It covers single-family homes, townhouses, and condominiums used primarily for residential purposes.

### 2.1. Inclusions:
*   Primary residences
*   Secondary/vacation homes (subject to additional review)
*   Condominium units
*   Owned mobile homes (permanently affixed to a foundation)

### 2.2. Exclusions:
*   Commercial properties
*   Rental properties (unless specifically endorsed with a landlord policy)
*   Properties under construction without a builder's risk policy
*   Properties located in designated high-risk flood zones or brush fire areas without specific endorsements or mitigation measures.
*   Properties with known pre-existing structural damage not disclosed or rectified.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Insured Property:** The residential dwelling and associated structures (e.g., detached garages, sheds) declared in the policy.
*   **Primary Residence:** The dwelling where the policyholder lives for the majority of the year.
*   **Full-Time Occupancy:** The property is inhabited by an owner or tenant for at least 10 months out of any 12-month period.
*   **Vacant Property:** A property with no occupants or contents, typically for more than 30 or 60 consecutive days (as specified in policy terms).
*   **Mitigation Measures:** Actions taken to reduce the severity or likelihood of a peril (e.g., hurricane shutters, alarm systems, updated wiring).
*   **Underwriting:** The process of assessing risk to determine whether to accept an application for insurance and on what terms.
*   **Peril:** A cause of loss (e.g., fire, theft, windstorm).
*   **Actuarial Risk Assessment:** Evaluation of the likelihood and potential cost of future events based on statistical data.

## 4. General Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible for home insurance, properties and applicants must meet the following general conditions:

### 4.1. Property Type and Condition
*   **Residential Use:** The property must be primarily used for residential purposes.
*   **Structural Integrity:** The dwelling must be structurally sound, free from significant unrepaired damage (e.g., cracked foundations, severely damaged roofs, water intrusion).
*   **Maintenance:** The property must be reasonably well-maintained, as evidenced by absence of chronic issues like widespread mold, pest infestations, or neglected landscaping posing hazards.
*   **Age of Systems:**
    *   **Electrical:** Must meet current safety codes; knob and tube wiring typically ineligible unless fully updated and inspected. Federal Pacific or Zinsco panels are generally ineligible.
    *   **Plumbing:** No active leaks, and lead pipes below ground are subject to review. Polybutylene piping is generally ineligible.
    *   **Roofing:** Must have an expected remaining lifespan of at least 5 years. Wood shake roofs or asbestos shingles may require specific underwriting approval or be ineligible.

### 4.2. Occupancy Status
*   **Full-Time Occupancy:** Properties must be occupied for at least [Company Specific Number, e.g., 90 days] per 12-month period.
*   **Vacant Properties:** Properties vacant for more than 30-60 consecutive days (depending on policy form) are generally ineligible for standard home insurance and may require a specialized vacant dwelling policy. Policyholders must notify the insurer if a property becomes vacant.
*   **Owner Occupied vs. Tenant Occupied:** The policy applied for must match the occupancy type. Standard home insurance (HO3, HO5) is for owner-occupied properties. Landlord policies (DP3) are for tenant-occupied properties.

### 4.3. Location and Environmental Factors
*   **Geographic Eligibility:** Properties must be located within the acceptable geographical underwriting zones of [Insurance Company Name].
*   **Hazard Zones:** Properties in areas designated as high-risk for specific perils (e.g., flood zones, seismic zones, wildfire zones, hurricane prone coastal areas) may require specific endorsements, higher deductibles, or may be ineligible without proper mitigation measures and actuarial risk assessments. Examples include:
    *   **Flood Zone A, V, AE:** Requires separate flood insurance.
    *   **Wildfire Prone Areas (e.g., California WUI):** May require defensible space reports, non-combustible roofing, and specific brush clearance.
    *   **Coastal Wind Zones:** May require impact-resistant windows, hurricane clips, or wind mitigation inspections.

### 4.4. Applicant and Policy History
*   **Claims History:** Applicants with a history of frequent or severe claims may be subject to higher premiums, specific endorsements, or denial. Typically, more than two property claims in the last five years may trigger underwriting review.
*   **Credit History:** A favorable insurance credit score may be required in some jurisdictions.
*   **Criminal History:** Applicants with felony convictions, particularly those related to arson, fraud, or property crime, may be deemed ineligible.
*   **Prior Non-Payment:** History of policy cancellation due to non-payment may result in denial or require payment in full upfront.

## 5. Review and Approval Process

### 5.1. Initial Application Review
*   All applications undergo an initial automated screening for basic eligibility criteria (location, prior claims history).
*   Underwriting may request additional documentation (e.g., photos, inspection reports, proof of mitigation).

### 5.2. Underwriting Decision Criteria
Underwriters will approve applications if:
*   All general eligibility requirements are demonstrably met.
*   The property's risk profile aligns with standard underwriting guidelines.
*   Any identified risks are adequately mitigated or insurable through endorsements or increased deductibles.

Underwriters will deny applications if:
*   The property or applicant fails to meet fundamental eligibility requirements (e.g., significant structural issues, unacceptable risks).
*   Required information or documentation is not provided.
*   The property's risk profile exceeds the company's acceptable risk appetite.

## 6. Exceptions

Exceptions to these eligibility criteria are rare and require explicit approval from the Chief Underwriting Officer or their delegated authority.
*   Requests for exceptions must be submitted in writing by the agent or underwriter, detailing the specific circumstances and any proposed compensatory risk mitigation.
*   Examples of potential exceptions may include: historical properties with unique construction, or properties undergoing significant renovations that will ultimately reduce risk.

## 7. Evidence and Documentation Required

Applicants must provide the following documentation as part of the application process or upon request during a claim:
*   **Proof of Ownership:** Deed, closing documents.
*   **Property Information:** Address, year built, square footage, construction type (frame, brick, etc.).
*   **Policy History:** Declaration pages from previous insurance carriers.
*   **Inspection Reports:** Lead-based paint disclosures, four-point inspections (roof, HVAC, electrical, plumbing) for older homes (e.g., built before 1990), wind mitigation reports (for coastal areas).
*   **Photos:** Exterior and interior photos as requested by underwriting.
*   **Survey/Plot Plan:** May be required for specific boundary or easement disputes.

## 8. Timelines

*   **Application Review:** Typically completed within 3-5 business days for standard applications.
*   **Underwriting Decision:** Up to 10 business days if additional information or inspections are required.
*   **Notification of Ineligibility:** Within 2 business days of a final decision, providing reasons for denial where legally permissible.
*   **Changes in Eligibility Status:** Policyholders must notify [Insurance Company Name] within 30 days of any material change to the property or its occupancy status that may affect eligibility (e.g., new additions, extended vacancy). Failure to do so may result in claim denial or policy cancellation.
