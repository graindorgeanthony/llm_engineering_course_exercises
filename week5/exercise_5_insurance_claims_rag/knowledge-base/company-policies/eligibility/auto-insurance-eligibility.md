# Auto Insurance Eligibility Criteria Policy

## 1. Overview and Purpose

This document outlines the eligibility criteria that individuals and vehicles must meet to qualify for an auto insurance policy with PrimeProtect Insurance Solutions. The purpose is to establish clear and consistent guidelines for underwriting, ensuring that policies are issued to acceptable risks, protecting the company's financial stability, and providing fair and transparent terms to policyholders. Adherence to these criteria is essential for both initial policy issuance and subsequent renewal.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all new applicants seeking individual auto insurance coverage, existing policyholders at renewal, and applies to all types of private passenger vehicles under personal use. Commercial vehicles, motorcycles, recreational vehicles (RVs), and vehicles used for ride-sharing or delivery services are excluded from these specific personal auto eligibility criteria and are subject to their respective specialized policies.

## 3. Definitions

*   **Applicant:** An individual applying for an auto insurance policy.
*   **Policyholder:** An individual who holds an active auto insurance policy with PrimeProtect.
*   **Insured Vehicle:** The specific vehicle(s) listed on an auto insurance policy for which coverage is provided.
*   **Rated Driver:** Any individual listed on the policy who is permitted to operate the insured vehicle and whose driving record influences the premium.
*   **Clean Driving Record:** Generally defined as no more than one minor moving violation and no at-fault accidents within the past 36 months, and no major violations (e.g., DUI, reckless driving) within the past 60 months.
*   **Salvage Title:** A vehicle title indicating that the vehicle has been declared a total loss by an insurance company.
*   **Modified Vehicle:** A vehicle that has undergone significant alterations from its original manufacturer specifications, particularly to its engine, chassis, or safety features.

## 4. General Eligibility Requirements

All applicants and proposed insured vehicles must satisfy the following fundamental requirements:

### 4.1 Applicant and Driver Eligibility

#### 4.1.1 Age Requirements
*   Minimum Age: All primary drivers and named insureds must be at least 18 years of age.
*   Drivers under 18 may be covered as secondary drivers on a parent's or legal guardian's policy, subject to additional underwriting review.

#### 4.1.2 Valid Driver's License
*   All rated drivers must possess a valid, non-suspended, or non-revoked driver's license issued by a U.S. state or territory for the vehicle class being insured.
*   International driver's permits are accepted only in conjunction with a valid foreign driver's license, subject to state-specific regulations and potential surcharge.
*   Learner's permits are generally not accepted for primary or sole drivers.

#### 4.1.3 Driving History
*   **Major Violations:** Applicants and all rated drivers are ineligible if they have any of the following within the past 60 months:
    *   Driving Under the Influence (DUI/DWI) conviction
    *   Reckless Driving conviction
    *   Hit and Run conviction
    *   Driving while License Suspended/Revoked conviction
    *   Fleeing/Evading Law Enforcement conviction
*   **Minor Violations:** Ineligibility may occur if an applicant or rated driver has more than two minor moving violations (e.g., speeding, improper lane change) within the past 36 months.
*   **At-Fault Accidents:** Ineligibility may occur if an applicant or rated driver has more than one at-fault accident within the past 36 months.
*   **Combination of Incidents:** A combination of one at-fault accident and more than one minor moving violation within 36 months may result in ineligibility.

#### 4.1.4 Residency
*   The primary named insured must be a legal resident of the state where the policy is issued and where the vehicle is principally garaged.
*   Proof of residency (e.g., utility bills, lease agreement) may be required.

### 4.2 Vehicle Eligibility

#### 4.2.1 Vehicle Type
*   Eligible vehicles include standard private passenger automobiles (sedans, coupes, hatchbacks, SUVs, minivans, and pickup trucks under 10,000 lbs GVWR) used for personal transportation.
*   Vehicles used for commercial purposes (e.g., taxi, delivery, ride-sharing, business travel exceeding 50% of total mileage) are not eligible under personal auto policies.
*   High-performance sports cars with excessive horsepower (e.g., exceeding 500 HP for certain models), exotic luxury vehicles, or vehicles with an MSRP exceeding $150,000 may be subject to specialized underwriting review and surcharges or deemed ineligible.

#### 4.2.2 Vehicle Condition and Title
*   Vehicles must have a clear title (not salvage, rebuilt, flood, or fire branded) at the time of policy inception, unless specifically approved by underwriting with supporting documentation (e.g., post-repair inspection certificate for rebuilt titles in some states).
*   Vehicles must be in safe operating condition, pass state-mandated inspections (where applicable), and be roadworthy.
*   Vehicles with significant pre-existing damage, or declared a total loss previously, typically are not eligible for comprehensive and collision coverage, even if the vehicle has a clear title.

#### 4.2.3 Vehicle Modifications
*   Minor modifications (e.g., aftermarket stereo, cosmetic enhancements) are generally acceptable.
*   Major modifications, particularly those affecting performance, safety, or structural integrity (e.g., engine swaps, suspension lifts over 4 inches, custom roll cages, nitrous oxide systems), must be disclosed during application. Such modifications may result in ineligibility or require specialized coverage with potential surcharges.
*   Vehicles modified for racing or off-road competitive use are strictly ineligible for personal auto policies.

#### 4.2.4 Vehicle Age and Value
*   While there are no strict age limits for eligible vehicles, older vehicles (e.g., 20+ years old) may be subject to an on-site inspection before physical damage coverage (comprehensive/collision) is offered.
*   Vehicles with a market value below a certain threshold (e.g., $1,000) may not be eligible for comprehensive and collision coverage due to diminished cost-effectiveness.

## 5. Underwriting Review and Decision Logic

All applications are subject to a comprehensive underwriting review which assesses the aggregated risk presented by all rated drivers and insured vehicles.

### 5.1 Automated Underwriting System (AUS)
*   Initial eligibility checks are performed automatically based on applicant-provided data and external data sources (e.g., MVRs, CLUE reports).
*   Applications meeting all "green path" criteria proceed to automated approval.
*   Applications triggering specific "red path" flags (e.g., major violations, excessive accidents) will be automatically declined.
*   Applications with "yellow path" flags (e.g., minor driving incidents, specific vehicle types) are referred for manual underwriting review.

### 5.2 Manual Underwriting Review
*   Underwriters will review flagged applications, considering factors such as:
    *   Severity and recency of driving incidents
    *   Specific vehicle characteristics and modifications
    *   Applicant's credit-based insurance score (where permitted by law)
    *   Geographic location and claims history data for that region
    *   Coverage requested (e.g., full coverage vs. liability-only)
    *   Duration of prior insurance coverage
*   Underwriters have discretion to approve, decline, or offer modified terms (e.g., higher deductibles, specific endorsements, limited coverage options) based on their assessment of overall risk. All decisions must be documented thoroughly.

## 6. Evidence and Documentation

Applicants must provide accurate and complete information. Providing false or misleading information may lead to policy voidance. Required documentation includes but is not limited to:

*   Valid driver's license numbers for all rated drivers.
*   Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) for all vehicles to be insured.
*   Proof of vehicle ownership (e.g., title, registration).
*   Current odometer reading.
*   Declaration of estimated annual mileage.
*   Prior insurance history information (carrier, policy numbers, dates).
*   For specific cases, photographic proof of vehicle condition or mechanic's inspection report may be requested.

## 7. Exceptions

Exceptions to this eligibility policy are rare and require explicit approval.

*   All exceptions must be approved in writing by a Senior Underwriting Manager or higher.
*   Justification for exceptions must clearly demonstrate that the deviation does not introduce unacceptable risk or that mitigating factors are in place.
*   Examples of potential, but rare, exceptions might include a historically loyal customer with a recent minor eligibility boundary breach.

## 8. Policy Renewal Eligibility

At each renewal cycle, policyholders are re-evaluated against the current eligibility criteria. Significant adverse changes to a rated driver's record (e.g., new major violations, multiple at-fault accidents) or changes to the insured vehicle's condition or usage may result in:

*   Non-renewal of the policy.
*   Increase in premiums.
*   Modification or restriction of coverage (e.g., exclusion of a specific driver, removal of physical damage coverage).

Policyholders will be notified in accordance with state regulatory requirements regarding non-renewal or significant changes to policy terms.
