# Statute of Limitations for Claim Filing

## Overview
This document serves as a comprehensive reference guide detailing the statutory periods within which various types of insurance claims must be filed across different U.S. states. The "statute of limitations" is a law setting the maximum time after an event within which legal proceedings, including claim filing, may be initiated. Adhering to these deadlines is critical to ensure claims are legally enforceable and prevent automatic denial due to untimeliness.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this reference is to provide claims adjusters, legal teams, and policyholders with a centralized, accurate source of information regarding claim filing deadlines. This ensures compliance with state laws, facilitates efficient claim processing, and aids in informed decision-making regarding claim viability and strategy.

## Scope
This document covers statutes of limitations for common types of insurance claims, including but not limited to:
*   Property Damage (e.g., auto collision, home structural damage, fire)
*   Personal Injury (e.g., auto accident bodily injury, slip and fall)
*   Contract Disputes (e.g., breach of insurance policy contract)
*   Bad Faith Claims (against the insurer)
*   Medical Malpractice
*   Wrongful Death

**Exclusions:** This document does not cover statutes for claims against governmental entities, federal tort claims, or highly specialized insurance products not listed above. It also does not constitute legal advice; users should consult with legal counsel for specific case interpretations.

## Definitions
*   **Statute of Limitations (SOL):** A law that sets the maximum time after an event within which legal proceedings may be initiated.
*   **Accrual Date:** The date from which the statute of limitations period begins to run. This is typically the date of the incident, the date of discovery of damage, or the date of loss.
*   **Discovery Rule:** A legal principle stating that the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the injury or damage is discovered, or reasonably should have been discovered.
*   **Tolling:** The temporary suspension or extension of the statute of limitations period, often due to specific legal circumstances (e.g., claimant's minority, mental incapacity, fraud by the defendant).
*   **Bad Faith Claim:** A claim against an insurance company for failing to act in good faith toward its policyholder.

## General Principles for Accrual
Unless otherwise specified by state law, the statute of limitations typically begins to run from one of the following events:
*   **Date of Loss/Incident:** The exact day the event causing damage or injury occurred.
*   **Date of Discovery:** The day the damage or injury was discovered, or reasonably should have been discovered, particularly for hidden damages or latent injuries.
*   **Date of Breach:** For contract-based claims, the date the alleged breach of the insurance policy occurred (e.g., denial of a valid claim).

## Important Considerations and Exceptions
*   **Minority/Incapacity:** For minors or individuals deemed legally incapacitated, the statute of limitations may be tolled until the individual reaches majority or regains capacity. Specific maximum tolling periods may apply.
*   **Fraud/Concealment:** If an insurer or other party fraudulently concealed facts pertinent to a claim, the statute of limitations may be tolled until the fraud is discovered or reasonably should have been discovered.
*   **Continuous Treatment Doctrine:** In medical malpractice cases, the SOL may not begin until the end of a course of treatment for the condition that caused the injury.
*   **Notice Provisions:** Many policies and state laws require prompt notice of a claim to the insurer, often much sooner than the statute of limitations for filing a lawsuit. Failure to provide timely notice can jeopardize coverage even if the SOL has not run.
*   **Contractual Limitations Periods:** Some insurance policies may contain contractual limitations periods that are shorter than the statutory period. While generally disfavored by courts if unreasonably short, these can sometimes be enforceable. Always check the specific policy language.
*   **Renunciation/Waiver:** An insurer may waive the defense of the statute of limitations if they intentionally mislead the claimant or act inconsistently with their right to assert the defense.
*   **Amended Complaints:** If an initial claim is filed within the SOL, subsequent amended complaints typically "relate back" to the original filing date, provided they arise from the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence.

## Decision Logic for Determining Applicable SOL
1.  **Identify the State:** Determine the state where the event occurred or where the policy was issued/governed.
2.  **Identify the Claim Type:** Categorize the claim (e.g., personal injury, property damage, contract dispute).
3.  **Determine the Accrual Date:** Establish the exact date the SOL began (date of loss, date of injury, date of discovery, date of breach).
4.  **Consult State-Specific Table:** Refer to the relevant state's section in this document for the base SOL period.
5.  **Check for Exceptions/Tolling:** Evaluate if any exceptions (e.g., minority, fraud, discovery rule) apply that would toll or alter the standard SOL.
6.  **Review Policy Language:** Check the specific insurance policy for any contractual limitations periods, and assess their enforceability.
7.  **Calculate Deadline:** Compute the final date by which the claim or lawsuit must be filed.

## Evidence/Documentation
Claim handlers must ensure that the following documentation is meticulously maintained for each claim, especially concerning
 timeliness:
*   Date of Loss Report (First Notice of Loss - FNOL)
*   Internal Timelines (adjuster logs, email timestamps)
*   Policy Effective & Expiration Dates
*   Relevant State Statutes (referenced with specific citation if possible)
*   Medical Records (for personal injury; to establish date of injury/discovery)
*   Repair Estimates/Reports (for property damage; to establish date of discovery)
*   Any correspondence regarding delays or extensions.
*   Proof of Service/Filing for court documents.

## Timelines
*   **Mandatory Initial Review:** All new claims must undergo an initial review within 3 business days of FNOL to assess potential SOL issues and notify the claimant if immediate action is required.
*   **Legal Counsel Consultation:** Claims with potential SOL concerns (e.g., approaching deadline, complex accrual scenarios, out-of-state claims) must be referred to corporate legal counsel for assessment at least 90 days prior to the calculated expiration date.
*   **Claim System Flagging:** All claim systems must be configured to automatically flag claims within 180 days of a calculated SOL deadline to ensure proactive management.
