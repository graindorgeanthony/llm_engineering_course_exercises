# Forensic Accounting Principles for Claims

## Overview
This document outlines the core forensic accounting principles applied when assessing complex insurance claims, particularly those involving business interruption, fraud, or significant financial loss. The purpose is to ensure a standardized, rigorous, and transparent approach to financial analysis, aiding in accurate claim valuation, fraud detection, and dispute resolution.

## Scope
These principles apply to all claims agents, adjusters, and third-party forensic accountants involved in the investigation and quantification of:
*   Business Interruption (BI) claims, including contingent BI and extra expense.
*   Fraud claims, including employee fraud, vendor fraud, and policyholder fraud.
*   Property damage claims requiring detailed loss quantification impacting financials.
*   Any claim where financial data analysis is critical for loss assessment or subrogation potential.

These principles do not cover general liability claims unless a specific financial loss component requires detailed accounting analysis.

## Definitions
*   **Business Interruption (BI):** Loss of income due to an insured peril, calculated based on historical financial data and projections.
*   **Forensic Accounting:** The application of accounting methods to legal problems, including dispute resolution or investigation of fraud.
*   **Fraud:** Intentional misrepresentation of facts to deceive or mislead, resulting in unlawful gain.
*   **Causation:** The direct link between the insured peril and the financial loss claimed.
*   **Mitigation:** Actions taken by the claimant to reduce the extent of loss following an insured event.
*   **Discovery Period:** The timeframe following an insured event during which the impact on business operations and finances is assessed.
*   **Period of Indemnity:** The maximum period for which the insurer is liable for business interruption losses as defined in the policy.
*   **But-For Scenario:** A hypothetical financial projection representing what the business's financial performance would have been "but for" the insured event.

## Core Principles

### 1. Objectivity and Independence
Forensic accountants must maintain an objective and independent stance throughout the claim investigation. All findings must be based on verifiable evidence, free from bias or undue influence from any party.
*   **Criteria:** All analyses must be peer-reviewed by an independent associate if internal, or conducted by a pre-approved third-party firm.
*   **Evidence:** Documentation of the independence declaration must be included in the claim file.

### 2. Causation and Attribution
The financial loss claimed must be directly and proximately caused by the insured peril. Forensic analysis must clearly establish this link and disaggregate losses attributable to the insured event from those caused by other factors (e.g., pre-existing economic downturns, unrelated business decisions).
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Identify the insured peril and its date/duration.
    2.  Analyze financial data immediately preceding, during, and following the peril.
    3.  Compare actual financial performance to a robust 'but-for' scenario.
    4.  Quantify the financial impact solely attributable to the insured event.
*   **Evidence:** Detailed financial models, variance analysis, market data specific to the causation period.

### 3. Materiality
Only financial discrepancies or losses that are material in nature will be considered for detailed investigation. Materiality is assessed based on the claim value, policy limits, and the potential impact on decision-making.
*   **Decision Logic:** Items below 1% of the total claim value or $5,000 (whichever is lower) may be aggregated or excluded from detailed review, unless they suggest a pattern of fraud.
*   **Exceptions:** Any amount, regardless of materiality, that indicates intentional misrepresentation or fraud will be fully investigated.

### 4. Data Integrity and Verification
All financial data used for analysis must be verified for accuracy, completeness, and reliability. This includes sourcing original documents, reconciling data, and addressing inconsistencies.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Sourcing: Original general ledgers, bank statements, sales invoices, purchase orders, tax returns, audited financial statements.
    *   Verification: Cross-referencing data points, performing analytical procedures (e.g., trend analysis, ratio analysis), and querying anomalies.
    *   Reconciliation: Ensuring consistency between different financial records.
*   **Evidence:** Copies of source documents, reconciliation schedules, data integrity reports.

### 5. Historical Performance and Projections (But-For Scenario)
Loss quantification, especially for business interruption, relies on establishing a credible "but-for" scenario. This involves analyzing historical financial performance, market conditions, and business plans to project what would have occurred had the insured event not taken place.
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Analyze 3-5 years of historical financial statements (P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow).
    2.  Consider industry trends, market share, economic forecasts, and internal business plans.
    3.  Adjust historic trends for non-recurring events or planned changes (e.g., new product launches, expansion, known customer losses).
    4.  Document all assumptions made in the projection model.
*   **Criteria:** Projections must be reasonable, supported by objective evidence, and exclude speculative future events.

### 6. Mitigation of Loss
Claimants have a duty to mitigate their losses. Forensic analysis must assess the reasonableness of mitigation efforts undertaken and adjust the claim quantum accordingly if adequate mitigation was not performed.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Assess actions taken: Were efforts timely and commercially reasonable?
    *   Quantify avoided losses: What financial impact was reduced due to mitigation?
    *   Consider extra expenses incurred due to mitigation efforts (e.g., temporary premises, expedited shipping).
*   **Decision Logic:** If mitigation efforts were demonstrably insufficient or unreasonable, the claim amount will be reduced by the amount of additional loss that could have been reasonably avoided.

### 7. Documentation and Transparency
All analyses, methodologies, assumptions, and findings must be thoroughly documented in a clear, concise, and reproducible manner. The documentation should be transparent, allowing for independent review and validation.
*   **Evidence:** Comprehensive work papers, detailed reports, data exhibits, and communication logs.
*   **Requirements:** Any adjustments, assumptions, or judgments made during the analysis must be explicitly stated and justified.

### 8. Policy Interpretation
Forensic accounting findings must be presented within the framework of the specific insurance policy's terms, conditions, and coverage limits. The quantification of loss must adhere strictly to policy definitions (e.g., insurable gross profit, period of indemnity).
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Review relevant policy clauses (e.g., BI wording, sub-limits, exclusions, deductibles).
    2.  Apply policy definitions to financial calculations (e.g., calculate 'insurable gross profit' as per policy rather than accounting gross profit if different).
    3.  Ensure the loss period aligns with the Period of Indemnity.
*   **Example:** If the policy defines "Gross Profit" as Sales less Variable Costs, but the claimant presents an accounting gross profit including fixed overheads, the forensic accountant must adjust.

### 9. Fraud Indicators and Red Flags
During financial analysis, forensic accountants must be alert to potential indicators of fraud.
*   **Common Indicators:**
    *   Unusual or unexplained transactions, large round-sum entries.
    *   Lack of supporting documentation for significant expenses or revenue.
    *   Significant deviations from historical financial trends without reasonable explanation.
    *   Missing, altered, or contradictory records.
    *   Unexplained wealth or lifestyle changes of key personnel.
    *   Inconsistencies between financial records and operational observations.
    *   Reluctance to provide requested documents or access to personnel.
*   **Action:** If red flags are identified, the forensic accountant must escalate findings to the claims manager and potentially to the investigative unit for further review.

## Exceptions
*   **Small Claims:** For business interruption claims under $50,000, a simplified analysis may be conducted, focusing on key components and reasonableness checks, provided no fraud indicators are present.
*   **Emergencies:** In declared emergency situations or catastrophic events, initial estimates may be accepted with a strong commitment from the claimant to provide full documentation for subsequent verification within a specified timeframe (e.g., 90 days post-event).

## Evidence/Documentation
All claim files requiring forensic accounting analysis must include:
*   Forensic Accountant's Engagement Letter.
*   Comprehensive Forensic Accounting Report.
*   Detailed Work Papers supporting all calculations and assumptions.
*   Copies of all primary source financial documents (general ledger, bank statements, tax returns, customer contracts, payroll records).
*   Signed Declarations from the claimant regarding the accuracy of submitted financial information.
*   Communication logs detailing all interactions with the claimant and their representatives.

## Timelines
*   **Initial Review:** Within 15 business days of receiving all requested financial documents.
*   **Draft Report:** Issued within 45 business days of completing the initial review, subject to claimant cooperation for data provision.
*   **Final Report:** Within 10 business days of resolving any open queries or receiving final clarifications.
*   **Data Retention:** All forensic accounting documentation and reports must be retained for a minimum of 7 years post-claim closure.
