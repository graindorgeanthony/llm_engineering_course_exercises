# State-Specific Auto Insurance Regulations

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive reference guide to foundational auto insurance regulations and mandatory coverage requirements across various states within the United States. Its purpose is to assist claims adjusters, underwriters, and legal teams in understanding the minimum legal obligations for motorists and the specific nuances of auto insurance policies as dictated by state law. This information is critical for accurate policy interpretation, claims processing, and compliance.

## Scope
This reference covers mandatory auto insurance requirements, including types and minimum limits of coverage, for all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. It specifically details requirements for Bodily Injury Liability, Property Damage Liability, Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist (UM/UIM) coverage, Personal Injury Protection (PIP) or Medical Payments (MedPay), and other state-specific mandatory coverages (e.g., No-Fault provisions). This document does not cover optional endorsements, commercial auto insurance regulations, or specific rating factors.

## Definitions
*   **Bodily Injury Liability (BIL):** Coverage that pays for injuries to another person caused by an accident for which the policyholder is at fault.
*   **Property Damage Liability (PDL):** Coverage that pays for damage to another person's property caused by an accident for which the policyholder is at fault.
*   **Uninsured Motorist (UM):** Coverage that pays for your damages if you're involved in an accident with a driver who doesn't have insurance.
*   **Underinsured Motorist (UIM):** Coverage that pays for your damages if you're involved in an accident with a driver who doesn't have enough insurance to cover your costs.
*   **Personal Injury Protection (PIP):** Often associated with "No-Fault" states, this coverage pays for medical expenses and lost wages for you and your passengers, regardless of who is at fault.
*   **Medical Payments (MedPay):** Coverage that pays for medical expenses for you and your passengers resulting from an accident, regardless of who is at fault, but typically does not cover lost wages.
*   **No-Fault State:** A state where, after an accident, each driver's own insurance company pays for their medical expenses and lost wages, regardless of who was at fault, typically through PIP coverage.
*   **Tort State:** A state where at-fault drivers are held responsible for the damages and injuries they cause in an accident.

## Exceptions and Special Considerations
*   **Affidavit of Financial Responsibility:** Some states (e.g., New Hampshire) allow drivers to provide proof of financial responsibility through means other than insurance, such as a bond or cash deposit. However, this is rare for standard passenger vehicles.
*   **Fleet Policies:** Regulations for commercial fleets or vehicles used for business purposes often differ significantly from personal auto policies and may have higher minimum limits or additional requirements.
*   **Non-Owner Policies:** Policies for individuals who drive but do not own a vehicle may have specific state limitations or requirements, particularly for liability coverage.
*   **Policy Stacking:** Some states allow "stacking" of UM/UIM coverages, meaning limits from multiple vehicles on a single policy or from multiple policies can be combined. State laws vary significantly on whether stacking is permitted and under what circumstances.
*   **SR-22/FR-44 Requirements:** Drivers convicted of certain offenses (e.g., DUI, serious moving violations) may be required by the state DMV to carry higher liability limits and provide specific proof of insurance (SR-22 or FR-44). These requirements supersede standard minimums.

## Decision Logic for Claims Processing
When a claim is reported, adjusters must:
1.  **Identify the State of Loss:** Determine where the accident occurred.
2.  **Verify Policy Coverage:** Compare the insured's actual policy coverages with the mandatory minimums for the state of registration at the time of policy inception and the state of loss (if different and relevant).
3.  **Assess No-Fault vs. Tort:** If the state is a No-Fault state, prioritize PIP coverage for medical expenses regardless of fault. In Tort states, liability must be established.
4.  **Confirm UM/UIM Elections:** Check policy declarations for UM/UIM acceptance/rejection and applicable limits, especially in states where it is optional.
5.  **Apply State Law:** In case of conflict between policy language and state mandatory minimums, state law generally prevails, and the policy is considered to provide at least the minimum required coverage.
6.  **Review Specific Statutory Details:** For complex claims, consult state statutes or legal counsel, particularly concerning definitions of "serious injury" in No-Fault states or specifics of UM/UIM application.

## Evidence/Documentation
For claims processing, evidence typically includes:
*   Insured's Declaration Page detailing coverage limits and elections (e.g., UM/UIM rejection).
*   Police reports which often identify the state of loss, vehicle registration, and sometimes insurance information.
*   State-specific insurance guides or statutory references from legal resources.

## Timelines
*   **Policy Updates:** This document is reviewed quarterly for updates to state regulations or legislative changes. The `effective_date` in the YAML front matter indicates the last comprehensive update.
*   **Claim Processing:** Claims involving inter-state regulatory differences may require extended processing times to ensure compliance and accurate coverage application.
