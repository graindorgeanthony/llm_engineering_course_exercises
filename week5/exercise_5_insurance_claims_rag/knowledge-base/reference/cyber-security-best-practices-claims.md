## Overview

This document outlines the essential cyber security best practices that all claims staff must adhere to when handling sensitive claimant information, processing claims, and using company systems. The primary purpose is to safeguard confidential data, prevent unauthorized access, mitigate cyber threats, and ensure compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA. Adherence to these practices is critical for protecting our reputation, maintaining trust with claimants, and avoiding legal and financial penalties.

## Scope

This document applies to all employees, contractors, and temporary staff who are involved in the claims process, regardless of their location (on-site or remote) or the devices they use (company-issued or approved personal devices). This includes, but is not limited to, claims adjusters, claims processors, claims managers, customer service representatives assisting with claims, and IT support personnel with access to claims systems.

## Definitions

*   **Claimant Data:** Any information related to a claims applicant or policyholder, including personally identifiable information (PII), protected health information (PHI), financial details, and case-specific narratives.
*   **Malware:** Malicious software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems (e.g., viruses, worms, ransomware, spyware).
*   **Phishing:** A type of social engineering attack where an attacker attempts to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, usually via deceptive emails or messages.
*   **Social Engineering:** Manipulating people into performing actions or divulging confidential information.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** An authentication method requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a resource (e.g., password + one-time code).
*   **Sensitive Data:** Any information that, if compromised, could cause harm to an individual or the organization, including PII, PHI, financial records, and confidential business strategies.

## General Best Practices

### 1. Strong Password Management

*   **Requirement:** Maintain unique, strong passwords for all company accounts.
*   **Criteria:** Passwords must be at least 12 characters long, include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using easily guessable information (e.g., birthdays, "password123").
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Use a company-approved password manager to generate and store complex passwords.
    2.  Never share passwords with anyone, including colleagues or IT support.
    3.  Change passwords immediately if you suspect they have been compromised.
    4.  Do not reuse company passwords for personal accounts.
*   **Evidence:** Regular audits of password strength and enforcement of company password policies by IT.

### 2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

*   **Requirement:** Enable MFA for all company applications and systems, especially those accessing claimant data.
*   **Procedure:** Follow IT instructions to set up MFA on your primary and secondary devices. Ensure your MFA device is always secure and accessible.
*   **Decision Logic:** Access to critical claims systems will be denied if MFA is not successfully completed.

### 3. Phishing and Social Engineering Awareness

*   **Requirement:** Be vigilant against phishing attempts and social engineering tactics.
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  **Verify Sender:** Always check the sender's email address for legitimacy. Look for inconsistencies, typos, or unusual domains.
    2.  **Inspect Links:** Hover over links before clicking to see the actual URL. Do not click suspicious links.
    3.  **Beware of Urgency:** Be skeptical of emails or messages demanding immediate action or creating a sense of panic.
    4.  **Confirm Requests:** If an email requests sensitive information or a financial transfer, verify it through an alternative, trusted communication
