# Adjuster Licensing Requirements by State

## Overview
This document serves as a comprehensive reference guide detailing the licensing requirements for claims adjusters across various U.S. states and territories. Its purpose is to ensure that all claims adjusters employed or contracted by [Your Company Name] maintain full compliance with state-specific regulations, including initial licensing, continuing education (CE), and understanding of reciprocal agreements. Adherence to these requirements is mandatory for all adjusters to lawfully operate and process claims.

## Scope
This guide covers general and specific licensing requirements for staff adjusters, independent adjusters, and public adjusters where relevant distinctions apply. It primarily focuses on property and casualty (P&C) licensing, encompassing requirements for all 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Exclusions include specialized adjuster licenses (e.g., Workers Compensation, Marine) unless explicitly noted as part of a general license, and international licensing requirements.

## Definitions
*   **Adjuster:** An individual who investigates insurance claims to determine the extent of the insurer's liability.
    *   **Staff Adjuster:** An adjuster directly employed by an insurance company.
    *   **Independent Adjuster:** An adjuster who works for a third-party firm hired by an insurance company, often on a contract basis.
    *   **Public Adjuster:** An adjuster employed by the insured (policyholder) to assist in the claims process.
*   **Designated Home State (DHS):** A state chosen by an adjuster as their primary licensing state, especially when their resident state does not require an adjuster license.
*   **Continuing Education (CE):** Mandatory educational requirements adjusters must complete periodically to maintain their license.
*   **Reciprocity:** An agreement between states that allows an adjuster licensed in one state to obtain a non-resident license in another state without having to meet all initial licensing requirements.
*   **National Producer Number (NPN):** A unique identification number assigned to licensed insurance producers (including adjusters) by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).

## Requirements and Criteria for Licensing

### Initial Licensing Process
1.  **Preparation:** Review state-specific requirements (age, residency, pre-licensing education).
2.  **Pre-licensing Education:** Complete required pre-licensing courses if mandated by the state (e.g., 40-hour course for Florida).
3.  **Scheduling Exam:** Register and schedule the state licensing exam through the state's approved testing vendor (e.g., Pearson VUE, Prometric).
4.  **Application Submission:** Complete and submit the Uniform Application for Individual Adjuster License via the National Insurance Producer Registry (NIPR) website.
5.  **Background Check:** Undergo fingerprinting and a criminal background check as required by the state. Results are typically submitted directly to the Department of Insurance.
6.  **Surety Bond (If Applicable):** For states like California or Nevada requiring a surety bond, acquire the bond from an authorized provider and submit proof.
7.  **Approval:** Await licensure approval from the state Department of Insurance. Licenses are typically issued electronically.

### Continuing Education (CE) Policies
*   **Biennial Requirement:** Most states require 24 hours of CE every two years.
*   **Ethics Requirement:** A minimum of 3 hours of CE usually must be dedicated to Ethics courses.
*   **Approved Providers:** All CE courses must be taken from state-approved providers.
*   **Reporting:** Adjusters are responsible for completing CE courses and ensuring their completion is reported to the state Department of Insurance before their license renewal deadline.
*   **Tracking:** [Your Company Name] utilizes an internal tracking system to monitor adjuster CE compliance and sends quarterly reminders.

### Reciprocal Agreements
*   **Home State First:** Adjusters must first obtain a resident license in their home state or declare a Designated Home State (DHS) if their resident state does not require a license.
*   **Non-Resident Application:** Once a resident or DHS license is active, adjusters can apply for non-resident licenses in other states through NIPR, leveraging reciprocity.
*   **Specific State Rules:** Note that some states (e.g., New York) do not offer full reciprocity and may require non-residents to pass their state-specific exam.

## Exceptions and Special Cases

### Non-Licensing States
For adjusters residing in states that do not require an adjuster license (e.g., Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts), a Designated Home State (DHS) must be chosen. This DHS must be a state that *does* license adjusters and where the adjuster intends to conduct a significant portion of their work. The DHS license then serves as the base for obtaining non-resident licenses in other states under reciprocity agreements.

### Emergency/Catastrophe (CAT) Adjuster Licenses
In response to widespread disasters, many states issue temporary emergency adjuster licenses.
*   **Eligibility:** Typically available to out-of-state adjusters in good standing, often waiving exam requirements for a limited period (e.g., 90-180 days).
*   **Conditions:** Requires sponsorship by an insurer or adjusting firm and may be contingent on a declared state of emergency.
*   **Example:** Texas Department of Insurance (TDI) issues Emergency Adjuster Licenses rapidly during hurricane season, valid for 90 days, renewable once.

### Public Adjuster Licensing
Public Adjusters are typically subject to more stringent licensing requirements, including:
*   Higher pre-licensing education hours.
*   More comprehensive examinations.
*   Mandatory surety bonds (often higher amounts than independent adjusters).
*   Specific ethical conduct guidelines regarding client solicitation and service agreements.
    *   **Example:** California requires a $20,000 surety bond for Independent Adjusters, but Public Adjusters in California must maintain a $20,000 bond *and* adhere to strict contract disclosure rules.

## Evidence and Documentation
Adjusters must maintain records of:
*   All current state licenses, including effective and expiration dates.
*   Certificates of completion for all CE courses.
*   Proof of surety bonds (if applicable).
*   Notification of any disciplinary actions or license suspensions.

These documents must be readily available for audit by the applicable state Department of Insurance and for internal verification by [Your Company Name]'s compliance department. All license numbers (including NPN) and expiration dates must be logged in the company's internal HRIS and licensing management system.

## Timelines
*   **Initial Application Processing:** Typically 2-4 weeks after all documentation (application, exam results, background check) is submitted.
*   **License Renewal:** Generally 60-90 days prior to the expiration date. Adjusters are responsible for initiating renewal well in advance.
*   **CE Completion:** Must be completed and reported at least 30 days prior to the individual license expiration date to avoid late fees or license lapse.
*   **Address Changes:** Must be reported to the state Department of Insurance and NIPR within 30 days of the change.
