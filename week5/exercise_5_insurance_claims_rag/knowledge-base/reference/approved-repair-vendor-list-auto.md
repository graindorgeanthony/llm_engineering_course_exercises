## Benefits of Using an Approved Vendor
Choosing one of our approved vendors offers several advantages to policyholders:

1.  **Guaranteed Quality Repairs:** All approved vendors provide a written warranty on their repair work for the life of the vehicle, backed by [Insurance Company Name].
2.  **Streamlined Process:** Direct communication and billing between the vendor and [Insurance Company Name] reduce administrative burden for the policyholder.
3.  **Faster Turnaround Times:** Approved shops often prioritize claims from [Insurance Company Name] due to established partnerships and efficient approval processes.
4.  **No Upfront Payments (for covered repairs):** In most cases, policyholders only pay their deductible, and [Insurance Company Name] settles the rest directly with the shop.
5.  **Rental Car Coordination:** Many approved vendors have on-site or preferred arrangements with rental car agencies, facilitating seamless transition to a rental vehicle if coverage permits.
6.  **Real-Time Updates:** Policyholders often receive automated repair status updates directly from the approved vendor.

## Requirements for Vendor Inclusion
To become an approved vendor, facilities must meet the following criteria:

*   **Licensing & Certification:** Possess all necessary state and local business licenses, as well as industry certifications (e.g., I-CAR Gold Status, ASE certification for technicians).
*   **Equipment:** Maintain up-to-date repair equipment, including frame straighteners, paint booths, diagnostic tools, and ADAS calibration equipment.
*   **Customer Service:** Demonstrate a consistent track record of high customer satisfaction.
*   **Warranty:** Offer a written lifetime warranty on all repairs.
*   **Pricing:** Adhere to [Insurance Company Name]'s agreed-upon labor rates and parts pricing matrices.
*   **Direct Billing Capability:** Ability to process claims directly with [Insurance Company Name] through electronic means.
*   **Insurance:** Maintain adequate liability and garage keeper's insurance.
*   **Environmental Compliance:** Adhere to all federal, state, and local environmental regulations.
*   **Audits:** Be subject to periodic quality and compliance audits by [Insurance Company Name].

## Procedures for Claims Agents
When a policyholder files a vehicle damage claim:

1.  **Initial Contact:** Verify policy coverage and capture initial damage details.
2.  **Recommend Approved Vendor:** Provide the policyholder with a minimum of three (3) approved vendors from the relevant geographic region. Guide them to select a preferred vendor from this list.
3.  **Estimate Review:** Ensure the chosen approved vendor submits a detailed repair estimate. Claims Adjusters must review and approve all estimates exceeding $1,000 within 2 business days of receipt.
4.  **Direct Billing Setup:** Confirm that the repair facility is an approved vendor to enable direct billing. If an unapproved vendor is chosen, guide the policyholder on reimbursement procedures.
5.  **Supplemental Approvals:** All supplemental estimates exceeding 15% of the initial approved estimate or $500 (whichever is greater) require adjuster approval prior to work continuation. Justification for supplements must be documented within the claim file (Claim ID: `[CLAIM_ID_FORMAT]`).
6.  **Repair Monitoring:** Periodically check on repair status for complex or high-value claims (over $5,000) or where delays are anticipated.

## Exceptions
*   **Policyholder Choice:** Policyholders have the right to choose any repair shop they wish, even if not on this approved list. In such cases, [Insurance Company Name] will pay for the reasonable cost of repairs, but direct billing and the extended repair guarantee may not apply. Policyholders will be responsible for upfront payment and seeking reimbursement.
*   **Emergency Repairs:** In situations where the vehicle is rendered inoperable in a remote area without an approved vendor nearby, emergency repairs to make the vehicle drivable are permitted. All subsequent major repairs should ideally be performed by an approved vendor. Documentation of the emergency repair (receipts, photos) is required.
*   **Specialty Vehicles:** For custom vehicles, classic cars, or highly specialized modifications not covered by standard repair protocols, an exception may be granted to use a specialized shop not on this list, pending approval by a Senior Claims Adjuster.

## Evidence/Documentation
Claims agents must document the following in the claim file:
*   Date and time the approved vendor list was provided to the policyholder.
*   Policyholder's chosen repair shop (approved or not).
*   All repair estimates and supplemental approvals.
*   Proof of repair completion (e.g., final invoice, photos).

## Timelines
*   **Initial Estimate Review:** Within 2 business days of receipt by the assigned adjuster.
*   **Supplemental Estimate Review:** Within 1 business day of receipt by the assigned adjuster.
*   **Direct Payment to Vendor:** Within 5 business days of receipt of final invoice and completion of repair.
