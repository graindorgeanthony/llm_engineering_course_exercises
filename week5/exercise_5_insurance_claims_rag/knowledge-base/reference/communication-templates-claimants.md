# Communication Templates for Claimants

## Overview
This document provides standardized letter and email templates designed for efficient and consistent communication with claimants throughout various stages of the claims process. Adherence to these templates ensures clarity, compliance, and a professional claimant experience. These templates are essential for maintaining a unified voice and expediting claim management by providing pre-approved messaging for common scenarios.

## Scope
This reference document applies to all claims personnel, including adjusters, claims processors, and customer service representatives, who are responsible for communicating with claimants regarding their open claims. It covers standard communications from initial acknowledgment to claim resolution and specific requests.
Excluded from this scope are internal communications, legal correspondence initiated by the legal department, and highly personalized or complex dispute resolution communications that require custom drafting.

## Definitions
*   **Claimant:** The individual or entity filing a claim.
*   **Claim ID:** A unique identifier assigned to each claim for tracking purposes.
*   **Adjudication:** The process of evaluating a claim based on policy terms and evidence to determine eligibility and extent of coverage.
*   **Proof of Loss (PoL):** A formal statement made by the insured claimant to the insurer, detailing the damages or losses incurred.
*   **Acknowledgment:** Initial notification to the claimant confirming receipt of their claim.
*   **Declination:** Formal notification to the claimant that their claim has been denied.
*   **Subrogation:** The right for an insurer to pursue a third party that caused an insurance loss to the insured.

## Template Usage Guidelines

1.  **Standardization:** Always use the approved templates provided herein. Do not modify content without explicit approval from a Claims Supervisor or the Compliance Department.
2.  **Personalization:** While templates offer a base, always replace bracketed placeholders (e.g., `[Claimant Name]`, `[Claim ID]`, `[Date]`) with specific claim details.
3.  **Accuracy:** Ensure all personalized information (dates, amounts, references) is accurate and consistent with the claim record.
4.  **Timeliness:** Send communications within specified service level agreement (SLA) timeframes.
5.  **Language:** Maintain a professional, empathetic, and clear tone. Avoid jargon where possible.
6.  **Record Keeping:** All outgoing communications must be logged in the claims management system (CMS) with the exact date and content sent.

## General Communication Principles

*   **Clarity:** Messages should be easy to understand.
*   **Conciseness:** Get straight to the point without unnecessary detail.
*   **Professionalism:** Maintain a respectful and empathetic tone.
*   **Action-Oriented:** Clearly state any required actions from the claimant or what they can expect next.
*   **Contact Information:** Always include a direct contact (phone number, email) for the claims handler or department.
