Its purpose is to standardize the understanding and completion of these critical documents, ensuring accuracy, efficiency, and compliance across all departments. Proper use of ACORD forms is essential for effective data exchange with carriers, clients, and other industry partners, directly impacting claim processing times and decision-making accuracy.

This includes but is not limited to, claims adjusters, underwriting staff, client service representatives, and administrative personnel. The guide covers the completion of specific fields, common pitfalls, and best practices for form utilization.

## 4. General Principles for ACORD Form Completion

1.  **Accuracy is Paramount:** All information must be factually correct and verifiable. Inaccurate information can lead to claim denials, delays, or legal complications.
2.  **Completeness:** Ensure all required fields are populated. If a field is not applicable, clearly indicate "N/A" rather than leaving it blank, especially for crucial fields.

*   **State-Specific Variations:** Certain states may have specific requirements or addendums to standard ACORD forms (e.g., Workers' Comp forms vary significantly by state). Always verify state-specific requirements.
*   **Digital Signatures:** While generally accepted, some carriers or jurisdictions may require wet signatures for specific forms or high-value policies. Verify acceptance from the receiving party.

## 7. Examples of Common Errors and Best Practices

| Error Type                       | Description                                                                                             | Best Practice                                                                                                         |
| :------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Missing Information**          | Leaving critical fields blank (e.g., policy numbers, limits, certificate holder address).                 | Use "N/A" if not applicable. Double-check all 'required' fields before submission.                                    |
| **Incorrect Dates**              | Incorrect policy effective/expiration dates, or certificate issuance dates.                               | Cross-reference with policy documents. Use system-generated dates where possible.                                       |
| **Misspelling/Typos**            | Errors in Named Insured, Additional Insured, or Certificate Holder names/addresses.                       | Verify against legal documents (e.g., articles of incorporation, contracts).                                           |
| **Vague Descriptions**           | Generic "Description of Operations" on ACORD 25, failing to reflect specific contract requirements.       | Tailor descriptions to match contractual language or specific project details. Reference specific endorsements.         |
| **Outdated Forms**               | Using old versions of ACORD forms.                                                                      | Always use the latest version available from the ACORD website or our internal document library.                        |
| **Incorrect Additional Insured** | Failing to attach the correct endorsement or referencing a non-existent clause.                           | Confirm the specific Additional Insured endorsement (e.g., CG 20 10 vs. CG 20 37) is on the policy before issuing. |

## 8. Evidence/Documentation Requirements

*   **Request for Certificate/Evidence:** Email, contract, or written request from the client or third party specifying requirements.
*   **Signed Application Forms:** For all ACORD application forms (125, 126, 130, etc.), a signed copy from the applicant is mandatory for binding coverage.
*   **Policy Documentation:** Actual policy forms, endorsements, declarations, and coverage summaries supporting the information provided on ACORD forms.
*   **Loss Runs:** Historical claims data over prior 3-5 years, critical for underwriting applications.
