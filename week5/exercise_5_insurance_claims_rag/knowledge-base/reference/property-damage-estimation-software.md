# Property Damage Estimation Software Guide

## 1. Overview

This document serves as a comprehensive reference guide for property adjusters using approved damage estimation software, primarily Xactimate, to accurately and efficiently assess property damage claims. The objective is to standardize the estimation process, ensure consistency in claim valuations, and facilitate quicker resolution for policyholders. This guide covers best practices, key features, and common scenarios encountered during the damage estimation process.

## 2. Scope

This guide applies to all property claims adjusters responsible for assessing and estimating repair or replacement costs for damaged residential and commercial properties. It covers the use of Xactimate software for creating detailed scope-of-loss reports, generating estimates, and managing project files.

### 2.1. Inclusions

*   Standard estimation workflows for common perils (e.g., wind, hail, water, fire).
*   Component-based estimating for structural, finish, and contents damage.
*   Application of pricing databases and localized cost factors.
*   Report generation and documentation standards.

### 2.2. Exclusions

*   Detailed software installation or troubleshooting guides (refer to Xactimate Help Documentation).
*   Specific policy coverage interpretations (refer to individual policy documents).
*   Catastrophic event (CAT) large-scale deployment procedures (refer to CAT Response Playbook).

## 3. Definitions

*   **Xactimate:** Industry-standard software used by insurance adjusters, restoration contractors, and service providers to estimate property damage.
*   **Estimate:** A detailed breakdown of the cost to repair or replace damaged property, generated using Xactimate.
*   **Scope of Loss:** A comprehensive document outlining all damaged items, the extent of damage, and the proposed method of repair or replacement.
*   **Line Item:** An individual entry in an estimate representing a specific material, labor, or service cost (e.g., "DRYWALL 1/2" HUNG, TAPED & SPACKLED").
*   **Price List:** A database within Xactimate containing millions of line items with localized pricing for materials and labor.
*   **Sketch:** The graphical representation of a property's layout and dimensions created within Xactimate.
*   **Xactimate Project File (.esx):** The proprietary file format for saving and sharing Xactimate estimates.
*   **Contents Listing:** An itemized inventory of damaged personal property, usually generated within Xactimate's Contents module or a similar tool.

## 4. Main Content: Estimation Workflow and Best Practices

### 4.1. Project Setup and Information Gathering

1.  **Create New Project:** Always start a new Xactimate project for each claim. Use the claim number as the primary project identifier.
2.  **Enter Claim Details:** Input all relevant claim information accurately, including policyholder name, claim number, date of loss, adjuster name, and contact details. This metadata is crucial for reporting and retrieval.
3.  **Property Details:** Enter the full property address. Utilize the built-in mapping tools to verify location and automatically adjust price lists. Specify property type (e.g., single-family dwelling, condominium, commercial).
4.  **Site Inspection Data:** Review all collected site data: photos, measurements, moisture readings, cause of loss reports, and policy details. Ensure all necessary documentation is available before commencing the estimate.

### 4.2. Sketching and Room Creation

1.  **Accurate Dimensions:** Draw the property layout accurately using the Sketch module. Input precise measurements for exterior and interior walls, rooms, and openings (windows, doors).
2.  **Room Labeling:** Clearly label each room and area (e.g., "Living Room," "Master Bedroom," "Kitchen," "Hallway 1"). This improves clarity and organization of line items.
3.  **Complex Structures:** For complex roofs or multi-level structures, utilize advanced sketching tools (e.g., roof wizard, multi-level structures) to ensure dimensional accuracy.
4.  **Openings and Features:** Add all relevant openings (doors, windows) and features (cabinets, fireplaces, skylights) to the sketch. These impact drywall, painting, and trim calculations.

### 4.3. Developing the Scope of Loss

1.  **Item-by-Item Assessment:** Go room by room, systematically adding line items for every damaged component. Refer to inspection notes and photos.
2.  **Damage Type and Repair Strategy:** For each line item, select the appropriate activity (e.g., "R&R" - Remove and Replace, "CL" - Clean, "R" - Repair).
3.  **Quantities:** Accurately input quantities for each line item (e.g., square feet for flooring, linear feet for trim, number for fixtures). Use the 'Estimate Items' tab and leverage the 'Recalculate' feature after Sketch modifications.
4.  **Consistency:** Ensure consistent application of repair methods and materials across similar damage types within the same claim.
5.  **Contents:** If applicable, create a separate Contents inventory using the Contents module, detailing description, quantity, condition, and estimated replacement cost value (RCV) or actual cash value (ACV).

### 4.4. Applying Pricing and Adjustments

1.  **Price List Selection:** Ensure the correct local price list is selected for the date of loss. Price lists are updated monthly.
2.  **Activity Modifiers:** Apply appropriate activity modifiers (e.g., "h" for high rise, "m" for difficult access, "s" for small quantity) as justified by the site conditions. Document justification in notes.
3.  **Sales Tax:** Verify that sales tax is correctly applied to materials according to local regulations.
4.  **Overhead & Profit (O&P):** Apply O&P (typically 10% for O & 10% for P) only when the scope requires the coordination of three or more distinct trades (e.g., carpentry, plumbing, electrical, drywall, flooring). Documentation should clearly justify the application of O&P.
5.  **Market Conditions:** If current market conditions necessitate adjustments beyond the standard price list (e.g., surge pricing due to a major event), obtain and attach contractor estimates as supporting documentation.

### 4.5. Notes and Documentation

1.  **Descriptive Line Item Notes:** Add detailed notes to individual line items to explain choices, specific conditions, or why certain quantities were used. Example: "R&R 20 LF Baseboard due to water staining, paint grade."
2.  **General Project Notes:** Utilize the 'Notes' tab for global claim information, adjuster observations, policy limitations, or communications with the insured.
3.  **Photos:** Embed or link all relevant photos directly within the Xactimate project file where applicable, ensuring they correspond to specific damaged areas or line items.
4.  **Supporting Documents:** Attach all supporting documentation: contractor estimates, engineering reports, drying logs, moisture readings, and policy endorsements.

## 5. Requirements for Estimate Finalization

*   **Completeness:** All identified damage must be included in the estimate. No hidden or omitted items.
*   **Accuracy:** Quantities, measurements, and line items must be accurate and justified by site data.
*   **Clarity:** The estimate should be easily understandable by policyholders, contractors, and internal reviewers.
*   **Compliance:** The estimate must comply with all relevant policy terms, state regulations, and company guidelines.
*   **Review:** Before submission, conduct a thorough self-review of the entire estimate. Verify:
    *   No duplicate line items.
    *   Correct price list and date of loss selected.
    *   Logical flow and organization.
    *   All necessary notes and attachments are present.
    *   Totals (e.g., deductible, RCV, ACV) are correct.

## 6. Exceptions

*   **Catastrophic (CAT) Events:** During declared CAT events, specific simplified estimating protocols or pre-approved templates may be authorized to expedite claims processing. Consult the CAT Response Playbook for current guidelines.
*   **Complex Commercial Claims:** For highly specialized commercial or industrial properties, supplemental expert appraisals or engineering reports may be required in conjunction with (or in place of) standard Xactimate estimates. Refer to the Commercial Claims Procedures.
*   **Contents-Only Claims:** For claims exclusively involving contents damage with no structural impact, a dedicated contents inventory system (e.g., Xactimate Contents module, or third-party solutions like CoreLogic ContentsExpress) may be used without a full structural estimate.

## 7. Examples

### 7.1. Water Damage Repair - Kitchen

*   **Room:** Kitchen

## 8. Decision Logic: Application of Overhead & Profit (O&P)

O&P should be applied only under the following, explicit conditions:

1.  **Complexity Threshold:** The scope of loss requires the coordination of three (3) or more distinct trades (e.g., roofing, carpentry, plumbing, electrical, drywall, painting, flooring, stucco).
    *   *Example 1 (O&P applies):* Roof repair, interior drywall patch and paint from leak, and electrical repair from short. (3 distinct trades: Roofing, Drywall/Painting, Electrical).
    *   *Example 2 (O&P does not apply):* Roof repair only, or interior drywall and paint only. (1 or 2 distinct trades).
2.  **Supervision Required:** The nature and extent of the repairs necessitate general contractor supervision and project management beyond the scope of a single specialty trade.
3.  **Documentation:** Justification for O&P application must be clearly documented in the project notes, listing the trades involved and the complexity requiring general contractor oversight.
4.  **Percentage:** When applicable, O&P is calculated at 10% for Overhead and 10% for Profit, applied to the total of materials and labor (subtotal of the estimate).

## 9. Evidence/Documentation

All estimates require the following supporting evidence:

*   **Digital Photographs:** High-resolution photos illustrating all damaged areas, including close-ups and wide-angle shots. Photos should be dated and geo-tagged if possible.
*   **Field Notes/Sketches:** Hand-drawn sketches or detailed notes from the site inspection, including measurements and specific observations of damage.
*   **Measurements:** Verification of all measurements used in the Sketch and Line Items (e.g., laser distance meter readings, tape measure photos).
*   **Policy Documentation:** Relevant sections of the insurance policy, particularly coverage forms, endorsements, and declarations page.
*   **Additional Reports (as needed):**
    *   Contractor bids/estimates (for comparison or specialized items).
    *   Engineer reports (for structural integrity or complex repairs).
    *   Drying logs (for water mitigation claims).
    *   Abatement reports (for mold, asbestos, lead).
    *   Contents inventory and valuation reports.

## 10. Timelines

*   **Estimate Draft Submission:** Within 3 business days of completing the initial site inspection, unless otherwise specified for CAT events.
*   **Estimate Revision:** Within 2 business days of receiving feedback or additional information.
*   **Final Estimate Approval:** Varies by claim complexity and value, but typically within 10 business days of draft submission.
*   **Price List Updates:** Xactimate price lists are updated monthly. Always use the most current list available for the date of loss, or the most recent available if the date of loss is prior to the current list.
