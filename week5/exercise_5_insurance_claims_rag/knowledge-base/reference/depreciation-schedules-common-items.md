## Overview
This document provides standard depreciation schedules for common personal property items used in Actual Cash Value (ACV) calculations for claims processing. These schedules are intended as a reference to ensure consistency and fairness in claim settlements. The rates are based on industry standards, expected useful life, and typical wear and tear under normal usage conditions.

## Scope
This reference applies to the valuation of personal property items damaged, lost, or stolen under homeowner, renter, and commercial property policies where ACV is the basis of settlement. It covers common household goods, electronics, furniture, appliances, and some personal effects.

### Exclusions
This document does not cover:
*   Real property or fixtures.
*   Specialty items requiring expert appraisal (e.g., fine art, antiques, collectibles, custom-built items, high-value jewelry).
*   Commercial machinery or industrial equipment.
*   Vehicles (automobiles, motorcycles, RVs, boats).
*   Any items with specific policy endorsements or unique depreciation terms stipulated in the policy contract that supersede these general guidelines.

## Definitions
*   **Actual Cash Value (ACV):** Replacement cost of an item minus depreciation.
*   **Depreciation:** The reduction in value of an asset over time due to wear and tear, age, obsolescence, or deterioration.
*   **Useful Life:** The estimated period during which an asset is expected to be useful for its intended purpose.
*   **Replacement Cost Value (RCV):** The cost to replace a damaged item with a new one of similar kind and quality without deduction for depreciation.
*   **Residual Value:** The estimated salvage value of an item at the end of its useful life, often considered to be 10-20% of its original value for many items.

## Depreciation Principles
Depreciation is primarily calculated using the straight-line method, where the annual depreciation is constant over the useful life of the item.

`Annual Depreciation = (Replacement Cost - Residual Value) / Useful Life (in years)`

`Total Depreciation = Annual Depreciation * Age of Item`

`ACV = Replacement Cost - Total Depreciation (capped at Residual Value)`

### Factors Influencing Depreciation
*   **Age:** The primary factor.
*   **Condition:** Items in unusually poor condition for their age may warrant additional depreciation; items exceptionally well-maintained may warrant less.
*   **Obsolescence:** Rapid technological advances can accelerate depreciation for electronics.
*   **Usage:** Heavy use can lead to faster depreciation; minimal use can prolong an item's value.

## Standard Depreciation Schedules

The following tables provide standard depreciation rates and useful lives. These are guidelines and should be applied with adjuster discretion based on specific item condition.

## Exceptions and Special Considerations

### Condition Adjustment
*   If an item's condition is significantly better than expected for its age (e.g., rarely used, meticulously maintained), adjust depreciation downwards by up to 10-20% of the calculated depreciation amount.
*   If an item's condition is significantly worse than expected for its age (e.g., heavy abuse, visible damage unrelated to loss event), adjust depreciation upwards by up to 10-20% of the calculated depreciation amount or justify a reduced useful life.

### Obsolescence
*   For electronics, if a model is severely outdated or unsupported (e.g., software updates no longer available), accelerate depreciation beyond the standard schedule, potentially to residual value irrespective of age.

### New Items
*   Items purchased within one year of the loss date, and demonstrably "like new," may have minimal (e.g., 5-10%) depreciation applied, or be paid at RCV if policy terms allow.
*   Some policies include "new for old" provisions for specific items; confirm policy language.

### Paired Items
*   If one item from a pair (e.g., a set of earrings, a pair of lamps) is lost/damaged and the remaining item(s) are rendered unusable or significantly diminished in value, the depreciation for the entire pair/set may be considered.

## Decision Logic for ACV Calculation

1.  **Identify Item:** Accurately classify the item based on claimant description and available evidence (receipts, photos).
2.  **Determine Replacement Cost (RCV):** Research current market price for a new item of like kind and quality.
3.  **Determine Age:** Establish the actual age of the item from purchase date or reasonable estimate.
4.  **Reference Depreciation Schedule:** Locate the applicable useful life, annual depreciation rate, and minimum ACV percentage from the tables above.
5.  **Calculate Depreciation:**
    *   `Annual Depreciation Amount = (RCV * (1 - Residual Value %)) / Useful Life`
    *   `Total Depreciation = Annual Depreciation Amount * Age`
    *   Always cap total depreciation at `RCV - (RCV * Residual Value %)`.
6.  **Calculate Initial ACV:** `ACV = RCV - Total Depreciation`.
7.  **Apply Condition/Obsolescence Adjustment (if warranted):** Evaluate the item's condition. If justified, apply a further adjustment to the calculated ACV. Document the rationale clearly.
8.  **Final ACV:** The adjusted ACV, not falling below the minimum ACV (residual value).

## Evidence and Documentation
Claim adjusters must document the following for each depreciated item:
*   Description of the item.
*   Original purchase date (if known) or estimated age.
*   Source of Replacement Cost Value (e.g., vendor quote, online retailer link).
*   Chosen Useful Life and Annual Depreciation Rate from this guide or justified deviation.
*   Calculated depreciation amount and final ACV.
*   Any condition or obsolescence adjustments made and the reasoning for them.

## Timelines
Depreciation schedules are effective from the `effective_date` specified in the front matter and are subject to periodic review and update, typically annually or as market conditions and technological advancements dictate. Claims will be processed based on the schedule active at the Effective Date of Loss.
