Its purpose is to streamline the claims process, ensure quality repair work, and maintain cost efficiency by utilizing vetted and reliable service providers. This list is mandatory for all claims agents when recommending or authorizing repair work covered under our standard home insurance policies.

## Scope
This list applies to all residential property claims requiring repair or restoration services where the estimated repair cost exceeds $1,000. It covers services such as structural repairs, roofing, plumbing, electrical, HVAC, water damage mitigation, fire and smoke restoration, and general carpentry.

*   Water Damage Restoration Services
*   Fire and Smoke Restoration Services
*   Mold Remediation Services (with pre-approval from Claims Manager)

### Exclusions
*   Claims where the policyholder elects to use their own contractor, provided the contractor meets specific licensing and insurance requirements and their rates are within reasonable market averages.
*   Claims under $1,000, for which agents may use discretion but are encouraged to refer to this list.
*   Commercial property claims (refer to "Approved Commercial Repair Vendor List").
*   Automobile repair services (refer to "Approved Auto Repair Vendor List").

## Definitions

## Requirements for Approved Vendors
To be included and remain on the Approved Vendor List, contractors must meet the following criteria:

*   **Licensing:** Possess all necessary state and local licenses for their trade. Proof of current licensing must be submitted annually.
*   **Insurance:** Maintain comprehensive General Liability Insurance ($1M minimum), Workers' Compensation Insurance (if applicable by law), and Commercial Auto Insurance. Certificates of Insurance (COIs) must be on file and updated annually.
*   **References:** Provide at least three professional references from previous clients or insurance adjusters.
*   **Performance History:** Demonstrate a track record of quality workmanship and adherence to project timelines.
*   **Pricing:** Adhere to fair and reasonable pricing guidelines, often based on Xactimate or similar industry-standard estimating software. Must provide detailed estimates for all work.
*   **Warranty:** Offer a minimum one-year warranty on all labor and materials for completed repairs.
*   **Communication:** Maintain clear and timely communication with adjusters and policyholders throughout the repair process.
*   **Background Checks:** All field personnel must pass a criminal background check.

## Vendor Selection Procedures for Claims Agents
When a claim requires repair services, claims agents must follow these steps:

1.  **Identify Service Need:** Determine the type of repair or restoration service required (e.g., roofing, water damage, general contractor).
2.  **Consult Approved List:** Refer to the relevant section of this "Approved Home Repair Vendor List" for available contractors in the policyholder's geographical region.
3.  **Prioritize Preferred Vendors:** Always attempt to utilize a "Preferred" status vendor first, if available and appropriate for the scope of work.
4.  **Obtain Multiple Quotes (Optional but Recommended):** For repairs estimated over $10,000, agents are encouraged to obtain at least two estimates from Approved Vendors to ensure competitive pricing and scope alignment. This is mandatory for estimates over $25,000.
5.  **Notify Policyholder:** Inform the policyholder of the recommended Approved Vendor(s) and provide their contact information. Explain the benefits of using an Approved Vendor (e.g., pre-vetted, warranty, direct billing options).
6.  **Authorize Work:** Issue a Work Authorization form to the selected vendor, detailing the approved scope of work and estimated cost.
7.  **Monitor Progress:** Maintain regular communication with the vendor and policyholder to ensure work progresses efficiently and to satisfactory standards.

## Reporting Vendor Performance
Claims agents are required to submit performance feedback for Approved Vendors through the "Vendor Performance Review Form" accessible on the internal claims portal (`claims.company.com/vendor_feedback`). This feedback is critical for ongoing vendor management and determining "Preferred Vendor Status."

## Exceptions
*   **Emergency Services:** In urgent situations where immediate action is required to prevent further damage (e.g., burst pipe, unsecured roof after a storm), the policyholder or agent may engage the first available qualified contractor. However, the agent must notify a Claims Manager for approval within 24 hours and ensure the emergency vendor submits a detailed invoice. Post-emergency repairs should then transition to an Approved Vendor if possible.
*   **Policyholder Preference:** If a policyholder insists on using a non-approved contractor, the agent must verify the contractor's licensing and insurance and confirm their pricing is competitive. If the non-approved contractor's estimate significantly exceeds that of an Approved Vendor for similar work, the agent must document the discrepancy and potentially only approve the cost up to the amount of the lowest Approved Vendor bid. Requires Claims Manager approval for deviations over 15% of Approved Vendor bids.
*   **Geographical Gaps:** In rare instances where no Approved Vendor is available within a reasonable radius (50 miles) of the property, a Claims Manager must approve the engagement of a new, vetted contractor.

## Timelines
*   **Vendor Selection:** A vendor should be selected within 48 business hours of the initial assessment for non-emergency repairs.
*   **Estimate Submission:** Approved Vendors are expected to submit detailed repair estimates within 3-5 business days of site inspection.
*   **Work Commencement:** Repairs should ideally commence within 5 business days of estimate approval, subject to material availability.

## Evidence/Documentation
*   Copy of Work Authorization form.
*   Detailed repair estimate from the Approved Vendor.
*   Photographs of damage (pre-repair) and completed work (post-repair).
*   Invoices matching approved estimate.
*   Any communication logs with policyholder and vendor.
*   Vendor Performance Review Form submission.
