## Expert Witness Engagement Procedure

### 1. Identify Need
The claims adjuster or legal counsel identifies the need for an expert due to complexity, liability disputes, causation issues, or potential litigation.

### 2. Search Directory
Search this directory by specialty, geographic coverage, or keyword to identify suitable candidates. Review their profiles, including hourly rates and experience.

### 3. Preliminary Contact
Contact the expert's firm to confirm availability, obtain a preliminary estimate, and discuss the specific scope of the engagement.

### 4. Obtain Approval
The claims adjuster must obtain approval from their Claims Manager or Legal Counsel prior to formally engaging an expert. The approval request must include:
    *   Claim ID
    *   Expert Name and Firm
    *   Reason for engagement
    *   Estimated total cost
    *   Detailed scope of work
    *   Anticipated deliverables (e.g., preliminary report, full report, deposition)

### 5. Issue Engagement Letter
Upon approval, a formal engagement letter must be issued to the expert. This letter must clearly define:
    *   Scope of work and specific questions to be addressed
    *   Deliverables and deadlines
    *   Agreed-upon fee structure and billing terms
    *   Confidentiality requirements
    *   Reporting structure (e.g., direct to adjuster, legal team)
    *   Compliance with company's expert witness guidelines (attached as an addendum).

### 6. Monitor and Manage
The assigned claims adjuster or legal counsel is responsible for managing the expert's work, ensuring adherence to the scope, reviewing drafts, and approving invoices.

### 7. Evaluation
Upon completion of the engagement, the claims adjuster/legal counsel should complete a brief Expert Performance Evaluation form (available on the intranet) to provide feedback on the expert's timeliness, quality of work, cost-effectiveness, and communication. This feedback informs future directory reviews.

## Requirements for Inclusion in Directory (New Experts)

*   **Licensure/Certification:** Hold all necessary professional licenses or certifications relevant to their field in all states where they practice.
*   **Experience:** Minimum of 10 years of professional experience in their declared specialty, with at least 5 years serving as an expert witness in claims or litigation.
*   **Education:** Hold an advanced degree (Master's, PhD, MD, JD) or equivalent professional credentials.
*   **References:** Provide at least three professional references from current or former clients, preferably from the insurance or legal industry.
*   **Peer Review:** Evidence of participation in peer-reviewed publications or professional organizations is preferred.

*   **Specialized Expertise Not in Directory:** If a novel or highly specialized claim requires an expert not currently listed, the Claims Manager, in consultation with Legal Counsel, may approve the engagement of an unlisted expert on a case-by-case basis. This requires expedited Vendor Management review and approval before formal engagement.
*   **Rate Negotiation:** Standard rates are preferred, but for complex or long-term engagements, the Claims Manager or Legal Counsel may negotiate reduced rates or alternative fee arrangements with the expert's firm. Any deviation from the standard rate card must be documented in the engagement letter.
