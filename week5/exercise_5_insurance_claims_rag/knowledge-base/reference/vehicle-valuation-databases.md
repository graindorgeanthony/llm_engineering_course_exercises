# Vehicle Valuation Databases and Guides

## Overview
This document serves as a comprehensive reference guide to the primary vehicle valuation databases and guides utilized by [Your Company Name] for the accurate assessment of Pre-Accident Actual Cash Value (ACV) in total loss claims. The consistent application of these resources ensures fair and equitable settlements for our policyholders.

## Purpose
The purpose of this reference is to outline the approved sources for vehicle valuation, describe their general application, and provide guidelines for their use in claims processing. This standardization helps minimize discrepancies, support claim decisions, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements regarding fair claims practices.

## Scope
This guide applies to all claims adjusters, appraisers, and claims management personnel involved in the valuation of damaged vehicles declared a total loss. It covers passenger vehicles, light trucks, motorcycles, and RVs, but generally excludes commercial fleet vehicles, specialized heavy equipment, or custom-built vehicles, which may require independent appraisal.

## Definitions
*   **Actual Cash Value (ACV):** The cost to replace damaged or stolen property with new property of like kind and quality, less depreciation, typically determined using market data.
*   **Total Loss:** A vehicle is declared a total loss when the cost to repair it, plus its salvage value, exceeds a certain percentage (e.g., 70-80%) of its ACV, or when required by state law.
*   **Condition Adjustments:** Modifications to a vehicle's base value based on its specific condition (e.g., mileage, options, prior damage, wear and tear).
*   **Market Survey:** A collection of comparable vehicles for sale in the local market used to validate or adjust valuations from standard databases.

## Approved Vehicle Valuation Databases and Guides

### 1. National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA Guides)
*   **Description:** NADA Guides provide comprehensive pricing and information for new and used cars, classic cars, motorcycles, boats, RVs, and manufactured homes. They are widely recognized in the insurance and financial industries.
*   **Application:** Primarily used for establishing a base ACV for a wide range of standard vehicles. NADA values consider regional markets, optional equipment, and mileage.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **"Clean Retail" Value:** Represents a vehicle in excellent condition, often used as an upper benchmark.
    *   **"Average Retail" Value:** Represents a vehicle in typical average condition, most frequently used for initial ACV assessment.
    *   **"Rough Trade-In" Value:** Represents a vehicle in below-average condition, useful in cases of significant prior unrepaired damage.
    *   **Adjustments:** Provides clear steps for adjusting value based on mileage and common options.
*   **Access:** Digital subscription via [Internal Link/System Name, e.g., "CCC ONE Valuations"]

### 2. Kelley Blue Book (KBB)
*   **Description:** KBB is a well-known resource for vehicle values, providing various pricing tiers including trade-in, private party, and retail values. It is highly recognized by consumers.
*   **Application:** KBB is often used as a comparative tool or for validating NADA valuations, especially in consumer-facing discussions due to its brand recognition. It can be particularly useful for determining "Private Party" sale values.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **"Fair Purchase Price":** An estimate of what consumers are actually paying for a vehicle, factoring in regional conditions.
    *   **"Trade-in Value":** What a dealer might pay for a vehicle.
    *   **"Private Party Value":** What an individual buyer might pay.
*   **Access:** Digital subscription via [Internal Link/System Name, e.g., "CCC ONE Valuations"]

### 3. Black Book
*   **Description:** Black Book provides wholesale and retail insights, primarily focused on auction data and real-time market trends. It is updated frequently.
*   **Application:** Black Book is often leveraged to understand the wholesale market value, which can inform salvage value expectations and further validate retail values. It is particularly valuable for assessing vehicles frequently sold at auction.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Wholesale Values:** Reflects what dealers pay for vehicles at auction.
    *   **Retail Values:** Based on dealer asking prices.
    *   **Daily Updates:** Provides current market insights.
*   **Access:** Digital subscription via [Internal Link/System Name, e.g., "Audit Stream"]

### 4. Other Valuation Resources (Limited Use)
*   **Salvage Auction Data:** For highly specialized or severely damaged vehicles where standard guides are insufficient, direct comparison to recent salvage auction results for similar vehicles may be used.
*   **Licensed Independent Appraisers:** In complex cases (e.g., highly customized vehicles, classic cars, exotics, or disputes), an independent appraisal from a certified professional may be commissioned.
*   **Local Market Surveys (Required for ACV Finalization):** Any valuation derived from the above databases *must* be supplemented and validated by a survey of comparable vehicles recently sold or currently for sale in the policyholder's local geographic area. This ensures the ACV reflects true market conditions.

## Procedures for Vehicle Valuation
1.  **Initial Assessment:** Upon determination of potential total loss, the claims adjuster will initiate a valuation using the primary system (e.g., CCC ONE or Mitchell Total Loss Valuation).
2.  **Database Selection:**
    *   For standard passenger vehicles, light trucks, and motorcycles, **NADA Guides (Average Retail)** values are the primary starting point.
    *   For RVs or manufactured homes, specific NADA publications dedicated to these categories must be used.
3.  **Data Input:** Accurately input VIN, mileage, relevant options, and confirm vehicle trim level. Ensure all significant features impacting value (e.g., 4x4, premium package, sunroof) are included.
4.  **Condition Adjustment:** Based on the vehicle inspection report (physical or virtual), apply appropriate condition adjustments to the base value.
    *   **Excellent:** Rare, factory-fresh or better. Minimal adjustment from "Clean Retail."
    *   **Good:** Well-maintained, minor wear, no major defects. Near "Average Retail."
    *   **Fair:** Moderate wear and tear, minor mechanical issues, some cosmetic defects. Requires downward adjustment from "Average Retail."
    *   **Poor:** Significant wear, multiple mechanical/cosmetic defects, requires substantial reconditioning. Significant downward adjustment.
5.  **Market Survey Validation:**
    *   Identify at least three (3) comparable vehicles (same make, model, year, trim, similar mileage, and options) that have been or are currently available for sale within a 100-mile radius of the policyholder's residence.
    *   Sources: Dealer websites, online automotive marketplaces (e.g., AutoTrader, Cargurus), classifieds.
    *   Document the source, asking price, and URL/screenshot for each comp.
    *   Adjust comp prices for any significant differences (e.g., higher mileage on comp, missing options on comp).
6.  **Final ACV Determination:**
    *   Compare the adjusted database value with the market survey results.
    *   If discrepancies exist (>5%), reconcile by reviewing specific options, regional demand, or expanding the market survey.
    *   The final ACV must be defensible based on the documentation from approved databases and the market survey.
7.  **Documentation:** All valuation reports, market survey data, and manual adjustments must be saved in the claim file.

## Requirements/Criteria for Use
*   All valuations must be performed by trained and authorized claims personnel.
*   Valuations must respect the effective date of loss. Historical data should be consulted if databases have updated significant pricing post-loss.
*   Mileage discrepancies of more than 5,000 miles from the average for the vehicle's age must be explicitly adjusted for.
*   All significant options contributing over $500 to the MSRP must be accounted for in the valuation.
*   Prior unrepaired damage must be explicitly factored into the condition adjustment.

## Exceptions
*   **Highly Customized Vehicles:** Vehicles with significant aftermarket modifications (e.g., custom paint, performance engines, specialty lift kits) may require an independent appraiser. Database values alone are insufficient.
*   **Classic/Vintage Cars:** Vehicles generally 25 years or older with collector's value are excluded from standard database usage and require specialized valuation services (e.g., Hagerty, agreed value policies, independent appraisal).
*   **Rare/Exotic Vehicles:** For models produced in extremely limited numbers, or high-value exotic vehicles, specific collector's guides or independent appraisals focusing on auction results may be necessary.
*   **Disputed ACV:** If a policyholder disputes the ACV determined by standard methods, an escalation process involving a review by a Senior Claims Adjuster or an independent appraisal may be initiated as per terms of the policy.

## Decision Logic for Database Choice
*   **Primary Source (Standard Vehicles):** NADA Guides (Average Retail) for initial base value.
*   **Validation/Consumer Facing:** Kelley Blue Book for comparative analysis and policyholder discussion.
*   **Wholesale/Salvage Insights:** Black Book for understanding auction value trends.
*   **Special Circumstances:** Independent Appraiser or Salvage Auction Data as an exception.
*   **Overarching Principle:** Always validate with a local market survey regardless of initial database source.

## Evidence/Documentation
*   Detailed printouts or digital reports from NADA, KBB, or Black Book reflecting chosen vehicle configurator inputs and adjustments.
*   Screenshots or printouts of market survey comparable vehicles, including vehicle details, asking price, and URL/source.
*   Any communication with the policyholder regarding ACV determination.
*   Documentation of any manual adjustments made and their justification.

## Timelines
*   Initial ACV determination for total loss claims is expected within 3-5 business days of receiving all necessary vehicle information (e.g., inspection report, ownership details).
*   Final ACV offer to policyholder within 2 business days of completing the valuation and market survey process.
