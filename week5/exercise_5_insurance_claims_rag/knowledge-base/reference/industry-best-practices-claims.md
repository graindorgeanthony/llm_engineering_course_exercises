# Industry Best Practices for Claims Handling

## Overview
This document compiles recognized best practices and standards within the insurance claims industry. Its purpose is to guide claims professionals, enhance operational efficiency, ensure fair and consistent claim resolution, and improve customer satisfaction. Adherence to these practices helps organizations mitigate risks, comply with regulatory requirements, and maintain a strong reputation.

## Scope
This document applies to all types of insurance claims processing, including but not limited to property, casualty, auto, and professional liability. It covers the entire claims lifecycle from initial notification to final resolution and covers practices applicable to claims adjusters, examiners, supervisors, and relevant support staff.

### Exclusions
Specific legal or regulatory requirements unique to a particular jurisdiction or product line are not detailed herein but should be referenced in conjunction with these general best practices.

## Definitions
*   **Claimant:** An individual or entity making a request for payment under an insurance policy.
*   **Policyholder:** The individual or entity who owns the insurance policy.
*   **First Notice of Loss (FNOL):** The initial report of a loss or incident made by a policyholder or claimant to the insurer.
*   **Adjuster:** An individual employed by an insurance company to investigate claims and recommend equitable settlements.
*   **Subrogation:** The right for an insurer to pursue a third party that caused an insurance loss to the insured.
*   **Reserves:** Funds set aside by an insurance company to pay for claims that have been incurred but not yet paid.
*   **Salvage:** The process by which an insurer takes possession of damaged property after paying a claim, and then sells the property to offset the loss.
*   **Service Level Agreement (SLA):** A contract between a service provider and a client that specifies the level of service expected.

## Core Best Practices in Claims Handling

### 1. Timely First Notice of Loss (FNOL) Engagement
#### Purpose
To capture essential claim details accurately and promptly, setting the foundation for efficient processing.

#### Requirements
*   **Availability:** 24/7 channels for FNOL (phone, online portal, mobile app).
*   **Data Capture:** Standardized FNOL templates to collect critical information: policy number, date/time of loss, location, description of incident, contact information for claimant/witnesses, police reports (if applicable).
*   **Initial Triage:** Immediate classification for severity and complexity to route to appropriate adjustor.
*   **Acknowledgement:** Automated confirmation to the claimant within 2 hours of FNOL submission.

#### Example
Upon receiving a motor vehicle accident FNOL, the system assigns a severity score based on injuries reported and vehicle damage, immediately routing high-severity cases to senior auto adjusters within 15 minutes.

### 2. Prompt and Thorough Investigation
#### Purpose
To ascertain facts, determine coverage, and establish liability accurately.

#### Requirements
*   **Contact Protocols:** Initial contact with the claimant within 24 business hours of FNOL. Additional parties (witnesses, police, third-party representatives) contacted within 48 business hours.
*   **Evidence Collection:** Systematized process for gathering evidence:
    *   Property claims: Photos/videos of damage, repair estimates, proof of ownership.
    *   Auto claims: Accident reports, driver statements, vehicle inspection reports.
    *   Liability claims: Witness statements, incident reports, contracts, expert opinions.
*   **Coverage Verification:** Immediate cross-referencing of reported loss against policy terms and exclusions.
*   **Liability Assessment:** Objective evaluation based on collected evidence, legal precedents, and policy provisions. Adjusters must document detailed reasoning for liability decisions.

#### Decision Logic
*   **Coverage Determination:** If the reported loss falls within policy terms and no exclusions apply, coverage is affirmed. If ambiguous, refer to claims supervisor or legal department for review within 3 business days.
*   **Liability Split:** For multi-party claims, adjusters decide percentage of fault based on evidence. If consensus is not reached, mediation or arbitration is considered.

### 3. Fair and Transparent Valuation and Settlement
#### Purpose
To ensure equitable claim resolution in accordance with policy terms and applicable laws.

#### Requirements
*   **Damage Assessment:**
    *   **Property Claims:** Use of standardized estimating software (e.g., Xactimate, Symbility) for structural and content damage. Two independent estimates required for damages exceeding $10,000.
    *   **Auto Claims:** Use of industry-standard valuation databases (e.g., CCC One, Audatex) for total loss vehicles or repair cost analysis.
*   **Medical Bill Review:** For personal injury, utilize medical bill review services and established fee schedules.
*   **Reserve Management:** Establish and regularly review claim reserves based on current estimated costs, anticipated litigation, and historical data. Adjusters must update reserves weekly for active claims.
*   **Settlement Communication:** Provide clear, written explanations of settlement offers, including itemized breakdowns of payments and deductions.
*   **Payment Timeliness:** Issue payments within 5 business days of settlement agreement, adhering to regulatory payment deadlines.

### 4. Proactive Communication and Customer Experience
#### Purpose
To keep claimants informed, manage expectations, and provide empathetic support throughout the claims process.

#### Requirements
*   **Regular Updates:** Proactive communication with claimant at least once every 7 business days for open claims, regardless of progress.
*   **Preferred Communication Channels:** Offer options for communication (phone, email, secure portal).
*   **Empathy and Professionalism:** Claims staff trained in empathetic communication techniques and conflict resolution.
*   **Documentation of Communication:** All communications (calls, emails, letters) must be logged in the claims management system.

#### Timelines
*   Initial contact: 24 business hours.
*   Status updates: Every 7 business days.
*   Response to inquiries: 1 business day for emails, same-day for phone calls during business hours.

### 5. Effective Subrogation and Salvage Management
#### Purpose
To recover funds paid out on claims where a third party is responsible or property has residual value.

#### Requirements
*   **Early Identification:** Subrogation potential identified during the initial investigation phase.
*   **Specialized Units:** Dedicated subrogation and salvage teams or trained adjusters.
*   **Timely Pursuit:** Subrogation demand letters sent within 30 days of claim closure.
*   **Salvage Disposition:** Damaged property is assessed for salvage value and processed for sale or disposal within 15 days of total loss determination.

### 6. Robust Fraud Detection and Prevention
#### Purpose
To identify, investigate, and prevent fraudulent claims that impact loss ratios and premiums.

#### Requirements
*   **Training:** All claims staff receive annual fraud awareness training.
*   **Technology:** Utilize fraud detection software that analyzes claims data for suspicious patterns and red flags (e.g., multiple claims from the same address/contact, inconsistent statements, policy inception claims).
*   **Dedicated Resources:** Establish a Special Investigation Unit (SIU) for cases warranting in-depth fraud investigation.
*   **Collaboration:** Cooperate with law enforcement and industry anti-fraud organizations.

#### Decision Logic
*   **Referral to SIU:** If an adjuster identifies at least two distinct "red flags" (e.g., claimant reluctance to provide documentation + suspicious prior claims history), the claim is escalated to SIU for review within 24 hours.

### 7. Continuous Improvement and Performance Monitoring
#### Purpose
To ensure claims processes are consistently optimized for efficiency, accuracy, and customer satisfaction.

#### Requirements
*   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Tracking and reporting on:
    *   Average claim cycle time (FNOL to closure)
    *   Customer satisfaction scores (CSAT/NPS) related to claims
    *   Accuracy of reserve setting
    *   Subrogation recovery rates
    *   Claims leakage rates
    *   Claim reopen rates
    *   Compliance with regulatory deadlines
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** Regular review of reopened claims or complaints to identify process breakdowns.
*   **Training & Development:** Ongoing professional development for adjusters, including legal updates, negotiation skills, and technical product knowledge.
*   **Audit and Compliance:** Periodic internal and external audits to ensure adherence to policies, procedures, and regulatory requirements.

#### Evidence/Documentation
*   Monthly KPI reports distributed to claims leadership.
*   Quarterly claims file review audits, with findings and corrective actions documented.
*   Annual training logs for all claims personnel.

## Exceptions
*   **Catastrophic Events (CAT):** During designated CAT events, some timelines (e.g., initial contact, damage assessment) may be extended due to high volume, with transparent communication to affected policyholders.
*   **Complex Litigation:** Claims involving extensive legal disputes may have adjusted timelines for resolution, requiring specialized legal counsel oversight.
*   **Regulatory Waivers:** In instances where regulatory bodies issue temporary waivers or modifications to standard practices (e.g., during pandemics), these will supersede standard procedures for the specified duration.
