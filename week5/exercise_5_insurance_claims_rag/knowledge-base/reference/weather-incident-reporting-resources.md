# Weather Incident Reporting Resources

## Overview
This document provides a consolidated list of trusted resources for verifying weather events relevant to property claims. Accurate and timely verification of weather conditions at specific locations and times is crucial for assessing claim eligibility, determining causation, and supporting claim decisions. This resource aims to streamline the process for claims adjusters and processors.

## Scope
This reference applies to all property claims that allege damage caused by weather-related events (e.g., wind, hail, flood, heavy rain, snow, ice, lightning, tornadoes, hurricanes). It includes national, regional, and local resources for historical and real-time weather data.

## Definitions
*   **NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration):** A scientific agency within the United States Department of Commerce focused on conditions of the oceans and the atmosphere.
*   **NWS (National Weather Service):** A component of NOAA, responsible for providing weather forecasts, warnings of hazardous weather, and other weather-related products to organizations and the public.
*   **Radar Data:** Information obtained from weather radar systems, typically showing precipitation type and intensity, wind speed and direction.
*   **Satellite Imagery:** Images of Earth collected by satellites, useful for tracking large-scale weather systems like hurricanes or fronts.
*   **Historical Data:** Archived weather observations, typically including temperature, precipitation, wind, and severe weather reports.
*   **Localized Report:** Weather data specific to a particular street address, zip code, or small geographic area.

## Main Content: Approved Weather Resource List

### 1. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) & National Weather Service (NWS)
NOAA and NWS are the primary official sources for U.S. weather data.

*   **NOAA Main Website:** [www.noaa.gov](http://www.noaa.gov)
    *   **Purpose:** General information, links to all sub-agencies.
*   **National Weather Service (NWS):** [www.weather.gov](http://www.weather.gov)
    *   **Purpose:** The authoritative source for current weather conditions, forecasts, and severe weather warnings for specific locations.
    *   **Usage:** Enter the exact street address or zip code for localized reports.
*   **National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) / NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI):** [www.ncdc.noaa.gov](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov) / [www.ncei.noaa.gov](http://www.ncei.noaa.gov)
    *   **Purpose:** Provides historical weather data, climate records, and storm event databases. Essential for verifying past weather events.
    *   **Key Functionality:** Access to daily/hourly observations, storm event databases, climate normals.
*   **Storm Prediction Center (SPC):** [www.spc.noaa.gov](http://www.spc.noaa.gov)
    *   **Purpose:** Specializes in forecasting severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. Offers daily outlooks and archived storm reports.
    *   **Usage:** Consult for incidents involving tornadoes, large hail, or damaging winds.
*   **National Hurricane Center (NHC):** [www.nhc.noaa.gov](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov)
    *   **Purpose:** Monitors and forecasts tropical cyclones for the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific basins.
    *   **Usage:** Critical for hurricane-related claims, providing track forecasts, wind speed probabilities, and rainfall outlooks.

### 2. Local Weather Stations and University Meteorology Departments
These sources often provide more granular, localized data and can sometimes offer expert analysis.

*   **Local NWS Forecast Offices:** Each state has multiple NWS offices responsible for local forecasts and warnings. They can often provide specific event summaries upon request, or their websites host local storm reports.
    *   **Usage:** Search "NWS [City, State]" to find the local office website.
*   **University Meteorology Departments:** Many universities with strong meteorology programs (e.g., University of Oklahoma, Penn State, Texas A&M) maintain archives of local weather data or conduct specific research studies on past weather events.
    *   **Usage:** For complex or highly localized inquiries where official NWS data might be less specific. Requires direct contact or specific website knowledge. Example: CIMMS at OU for radar analysis.

### 3. Commercial Weather Data Providers (Supplemental)
While official sources are preferred, these can offer user-friendly interfaces and specialized reports. Usage of these sources should be cross-referenced with primary NOAA/NWS data where possible.

*   **Weather Underground (Wunderground):** [www.wunderground.com](http://www.wunderground.com)
    *   **Purpose:** Aggregates data from personal weather stations, offering highly localized current conditions and historical data.
    *   **Caution:** Data from personal stations may not always meet NWS calibration standards. Use for supporting, not primary, evidence unless verified.
*   **AccuWeather / The Weather Channel:** [www.accuweather.com](http://www.accuweather.com), [www.weather.com](http://www.weather.com)
    *   **Purpose:** Provides forecasts, current conditions, and some historical data. Often used for general public information.
    *   **Usage:** Useful for general context but less detailed for forensic analysis than NOAA sources.
*   **Private Meteorological Consulting Firms:** Various firms offer detailed forensic meteorological reports for a fee, including radar analysis, wind modeling, and expert testimony.
    *   **Usage:** Employed for complex, high-value, or litigated claims where granular, expert analysis is required. Requires management approval and budget allocation.

## Requirements/Criteria for Use
*   **Specificity:** Always strive for weather data specific to the exact claim location (street address) and time of loss.
*   **Date Range:** Obtain data covering the incident date and a reasonable period before/after to understand the broader weather context.
*   **Official Sources First:** Prioritize NOAA, NWS, and other government-operated meteorological sites as primary evidence.
*   **Documentation:** All retrieved weather reports and data must be saved and attached to the claim file, clearly indicating the source and date of retrieval. Screenshots should include the URL and timestamp.

## Evidence/Documentation
For every weather-related property claim, the claim file must contain:
1.  **Localized Weather Report:** From weather.gov using the property address, showing conditions for the date and time of loss.
2.  **Severe Weather Reports (if applicable):** From SPC or NCDC/NCEI for hail, wind, or tornado events.
3.  **Radar Imagery (if applicable):** Snapshot of radar showing precipitation or storm cells over the incident location at the time of loss (e.g., from NWS or a private meteorologist).
4.  **Flood Maps/Warnings (if applicable):** From NOAA/NWS or FEMA flood plain maps.

## Exceptions
*   In cases where detailed localized data is unavailable from standard sources (e.g., very remote locations), a broader regional report may be used, with a clear notation in the claim file explaining the limitation and reasoning. This requires supervisor approval.
*   For widespread events (e.g., hurricanes, blizzards), regional NWS statements and historical reports (e.g., NCDC storm event database) are acceptable supplementary evidence.

## Timelines
Weather event verification should be conducted as early as possible in the claims handling process, ideally within 24-48 hours of claim assignment, to facilitate accurate initial assessment and reserving.
