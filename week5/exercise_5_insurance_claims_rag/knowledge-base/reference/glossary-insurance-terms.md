# Glossary of Insurance Terms for Claims Management

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive glossary of key terms and acronyms frequently used within the insurance industry, particularly in the context of claims processing and management. Its purpose is to ensure consistent understanding and communication among claims adjusters, customer service representatives, policyholders, and other stakeholders.

## Scope
This glossary applies to all personnel involved in the underwriting, policy administration, and claims handling processes across all lines of business offered by our company. It serves as a foundational reference for understanding policy documents, claims reports, and internal communications.

## Definitions

### A
*   **Actual Cash Value (ACV):** The cost to replace damaged or stolen property, minus depreciation. This is generally calculated based on the item's age, condition, and expected lifespan at the time of loss.
*   **Adjuster (Claims Adjuster):** An individual who investigates insurance claims to determine the extent of the company's liability and the amount of loss payable under a policy. Can be staff adjusters (company employees), independent adjusters (contracted by the insurer), or public adjusters (hired by the policyholder).
*   **Additional Insured:** A person or entity, other than the named insured, who is protected by an insurance policy. This protection is often limited to specific interests or circumstances.
*   **Aggregate Limit:** The maximum amount an insurer will pay for all covered losses during a policy period, regardless of the number of claims. Once this limit is reached, no further payments will be made until the next policy period.
*   **Appraisal:** A process used to resolve disputes between an insurer and a policyholder over the amount of a loss. Both parties hire an appraiser, and if they can't agree, an umpire is chosen to make a binding decision.
*   **Arbitration:** A method of dispute resolution where an impartial third party (arbitrator) hears evidence and makes a decision, which may or may not be legally binding. Often used to settle disputes without litigation.

### B
*   **Beneficiary:** The person or entity designated to receive the benefits from an insurance policy, such as a life insurance payout.
*   **Bind (Binding Coverage):** To put an insurance policy into effect immediately, even before the physical policy document is issued. This is typically done by an agent or underwriter.
*   **Bodily Injury (BI):** Physical harm, sickness, or disease sustained by a person. In liability insurance, it refers to the harm caused to a third party for which the insured is legally responsible.

### C
*   **Cancellation:** The termination of an insurance policy by either the insured or the insurer before its expiration date. Reasons for cancellation vary by policy type and jurisdiction.
*   **Catastrophe (CAT Loss):** A sudden, severe, and large-scale disaster, such as a hurricane, earthquake, or flood, that causes widespread damage and a large number of claims. Often triggers special claims handling protocols.
*   **Certificate of Insurance:** A document issued by an insurer that provides evidence of insurance coverage. It summarizes the key terms and conditions of the policy without providing full policy details.
*   **Claim:** A formal request by a policyholder to an insurance company for coverage or compensation for a covered loss or policy event.
*   **Claimant:** The person or entity making a claim. This can be the policyholder or an injured third party.
*   **Coinsurance:**
    1.  *(Property Insurance)* A provision requiring the policyholder to insure property for a certain percentage of its value (e.g., 80%). If underinsured, the policyholder shares in the loss proportionally.
    2.  *(Health Insurance)* A percentage of the medical costs the insured is required to pay after their deductible has been met.
*   **Collision Coverage:** Auto insurance coverage that pays for damage to the insured's vehicle resulting from a collision with another vehicle, object, or upset of the vehicle.
*   **Combined Single Limit (CSL):** A single limit of liability coverage for both bodily injury and property damage, rather than separate limits for each.
*   **Comprehensive Coverage:** Auto insurance coverage that pays for damage to the insured's vehicle from perils other than collision, such as theft, fire, vandalism, falling objects, or impact with animals.
*   **Conditions:** The part of an insurance policy that outlines the duties and responsibilities of both the insured and the insurer. Failure to meet these conditions can jeopardize coverage.

*   **Depreciation:** The decrease in value of property over time due to wear and tear, age, or obsolescence. Used in calculating Actual Cash Value.

### E
*   **Effective Date:** The date on which an insurance policy or coverage officially begins.
*   **Endorsement:** An amendment or addition to an existing insurance policy that changes its terms or scope of coverage. Also known as a "rider."

### N
*   **Named Insured:** The individual or entity specifically listed on the declarations page of an insurance policy as being covered.
*   **Notice of Loss:** The formal notification given to an insurance company by the insured or claimant that a loss has occurred. Typically a requirement for a claim to be considered.

### T
*   **Third-Party Claim:** A claim filed by someone other than the policyholder against the policyholder's liability insurance.
*   **Total Loss:** When the cost to repair damaged property exceeds its actual cash value or a percentage of its value defined by policy or state law (e.g., 75% of ACV). The insurer pays the ACV of the property, and the insured surrenders the damaged property (salvage).

### U
*   **Underwriter:** An insurance professional who evaluates applications for insurance, assesses risk, and determines the appropriate premium and terms of coverage.
*   **Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist (UM/UIM) Coverage:** Auto insurance coverage that protects the insured in the event of an accident with a driver who has no insurance (UM) or insufficient insurance (UIM) to cover the damages.
